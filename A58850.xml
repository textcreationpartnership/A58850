            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onſidering with my ſelfe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the many polemicall or contentious Diſcourſes about Religion, and that Chriſtian, this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie Age hath produced, it might be feared that through the ſubtiltie of the Old Serpent, ſuch ſtrifes may have the mortall event upon too many, of liking no Religion at all: To prevent or obviate ſo great an evill, I found my ſelfe inclined very much to treat of ſuch a Subject as might, by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, conduce much as well to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging of mens mindes to the Faith and fear of God in generall, as to reconcile Chriſtians one to another, rather than divide them farther, or encreaſe Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities between them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59605:3"/>
            <p>But I muſt confeſſe a more ſpeciall reaſon hereunto exciting me how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient ſoever I found my ſelfe to the worthy perfourmance of ſo good work, was the conſideration of ſome Perſons of our Communion, I mean the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Religion in this Iſle, who though ſhining with Pietie and devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God to the ecclipſing of phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick lights lately appearing; do keep up that temper of Spirit, to which our Saviour Chriſt hath affixed this Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſed are they who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> For as <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great hath it in an Homilie on the Goſpells; Herein differ the delights of the bodie, and the Soule, that bodily pleaſures, while we have them not, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle in us a ſore deſire of them: but ſo ſoon as we devour them greedily, they turn to loathing through ſatietie: but on the contrarie, ſpirituall pleaſures are onely loathed, when we have them
<pb facs="tcp:59605:3"/> not; and are ſo much the more thirſted after, by how much more they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the hungring Soule. And this kinde of hunger, obſerving to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in them, by converſing with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Books wrote by others, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my generall Office, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Obligations to ſuch Perſons in a manner demanded of me an endeavour to gratifie ſuch religious Appetites. And hereupon I choſe rather to publiſh mine own inabilitie, than to fruſtrate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of ſuch Chriſtian Spirits; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending hereby to divert them with a mean view and ſenſe of heavenly things, which as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. are <hi>the earneſt of our inheritance, untill the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion, unto the praiſe of his glorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will appear by the Methode I have here choſen and the manner of my proceeding in this Diſcourſe, that it was not my principall, much leſſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſigne to be uſefull to greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or ſublimer Chriſtians, but to the
<pb facs="tcp:59605:4"/> loweſt and meaneſt of both Orders, I having laid my foundation ſo low as the weakeſt may reſt on, and improve by, and ſo raiſe themſelves by orderly gradations to a more conſiderable height. Which courſe I have taken not out of affectation of ſingularitie, as ſome may conjecture who are either wholly ignorant that this is of very long ſtanding in the Catholick Church, or doe know that books of Devotion in our Mother-Tongue have very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if at all, inſiſted on this Subject, or trodden the ſame path with me: and they of the Unreformed Church who have often treated of this matter, have very ſeldome handled all theſe parts of Piety together: but paſſing over light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Illuminative and Purgative parts of Religion, have ambitiouſly (to my apprehenſion) ſtrived to abound and excell in the Unitive-Way, and their Myſticall Theologie, ſoaring very high, if not exorbitantly towards Heaven, and gaining to themſelves and Church
<pb facs="tcp:59605:4"/> no ſmall eſtimation for divine Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, ſtrange Notions and Language, as if they had themſelves been wrapt up into the Third Heaven, as was Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and were priviledged to doe what was denied him: <hi>viz.</hi> to utter thoſe unſpeakable words, which he tells us, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. <hi>It is not lawfull for any man to utter:</hi> and exalting Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the undervaluing of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and active life: under pretence that <hi>Marie,</hi> who ſate ſtill, not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt being preſent, choſe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part; and <hi>Martha,</hi> the inferiour, in ſerving of Chriſt: which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it be ſo generally received and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by Scholaſticall as well as My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Doctours auntienter and later, ſeems to me to be no otherwiſe true, than as <hi>Mary</hi> repreſented the ſtate of bliſſe hereafter, conſiſting alltogether of Contemplation and Affection; and <hi>Martha,</hi> the ſtate of a Chriſtian in this Life, in which unactive Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and barren in the work of the
<pb facs="tcp:59605:5"/> Lord is ſcarce laudable; and, as the <hi>Quietiſts</hi> are ſaid to magnifie it not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; they amongſt other notorious Errours charged upon them excluding divine Meditation from their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, by too great niceneſſe: though we our ſelves have in this Treatiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed them as degrees conſiſtent one with another, ſo far as they are Acts of the ſpirituall life we now live.</p>
            <p>For according to our preſent Subject; we firſt, not without good advice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſimple Intelligence or knowledge of God, acquired by Illumination of the naturall Man, whereby a Chriſtian comes to a right belief of God, and a knowledge of himſelfe, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner in good meaſure of Spirits, and fallacious Viſions, and Revelations.</p>
            <p>This being competently attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, diſpoſes the Soule to right Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it ſelfe, from the inveterate evills of ſin corrupting and afflicting it, which is the Purgative way every true Chriſtian ſhould exerciſe himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:59605:5"/> in, untill he hath purged out the Old Leaven, and caſt out the Old Man, of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Luſts.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it ſuffices not to denye, and even to dye unto worldly luſts (if this may be ſuppoſed) unleſſe we allſo live the life of Chriſt, and be truely united unto God through him, and that by thoſe proper helps and aſcents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by him, and in ſome manner by us deſcribed here, therefore doe we proceed to the third State of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, commonly called, the <hi>Unitive;</hi> wherein is to be found that true reſt of the Soule promiſed by Chriſt: not ſo as to ceaſe from a poſſibility of ſinning, or ſuffering perturbations, as late <hi>Quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> are allſo reported wickedly to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but ſo as to prefer God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe above all things in the World; and by love of and delight in them to perſevere immutably to perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation in bliſſe hereafter.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59605:6"/>
            <p>And having thus given thee, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader, a brief account and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of my preſent Deſigne, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt my ſelfe to thy favourable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and commend thee to God, and to the word of his Grace which is able to build thee up, and to give thee an inheritance among all ſuch as are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THERE being three principall Stages (as I may ſo ſpeak) which every true Chriſtian is to paſſe over in his travail towards that Sabbath of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59605:10"/> hoped for hereafter, and aſpired to, it may ſeem both very methodicall and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to that great end, to prepare the way thither by cleering up the defaced Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters written by Gods own finger on the tables of Mans heart concerning the ſenſe of God and Religion towards him, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: that ſuch a fundamentall perſwaſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well received, the edification in our moſt holy faith may be more firme, abſolute, and better advanced.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For what may we call Religion (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here more practically than artificially) but a thorow conviction of a Supream Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Power, able to ſave and deſtroy everlaſtingly; inferring a ſtrong and juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, upon all creatures, eſpecially Man, to pay the debt of veneration and obedience to that God from whom he received his preſent being, and to whom he owes his ſubſiſtence, and upon whom depends his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of happineſſe or miſery.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But may it not here allſo be ſaid, <hi>Who hath believed our report, and to whom hath the Arme of the Lord been revealed?</hi> too many obſtinately refuſing any better gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or conduct of their Lives, but ſuch as may favour their degenerous and dangerous humour of gratifying their ſenſuall appetites, hurrying them to a liberty inconſiſtent with that whereby we are made free to God by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59605:10"/> Chriſt Jeſus. For his ſervice being perfect freedome', when we are dedicated to him in Baptiſme, we renounce the ſervitude, and turpitude of the world; and enter our ſelves Apprentices to learne and doe the will of God, by Religion, the Art of all Arts: God at the ſame time Indenting and Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Believers ſo faithfully ſerving him, when their times come out by death, in this world, to give them a more noble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable freedome, by making them Citizens in Hieruſalem which is above, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us all; than which the heart of man can deſire no greater or better event of all his labours and ſervices in the world, nor ſo good, nor great remuneration.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Who would not then ſometimes retire into the chamber of his heart, and ſeriouſly conſider theſe things? And who conſidering theſe things, would not apply himſelfe to this ſo neceſſary, ſo divine and beneficiall a work? ſhall we ſee ſo many Artiſts of this world ſtrive to excell one another, not only for lucre ſake, but eſteem of men, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall profeſſions and trades, and ſhall we be cold, indifferent, and careleſſe in this of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the glory of all? How many have become poor, infamous, miſerable, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed finally merely for want of Religion better informing and governing them? And how many on the other ſide, hath Religion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59605:11"/> celebrated and immortalized, above all other arts, ſciences, or heroick Feats in the world? How many pittifull perſons in the eye of the world for birth, parts, education, poſſeſſions and the like, admired by the world, have outſhin'd men even in this world, in true honour; whom yet the world has account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt renowned and happy, and after this life have perpetuated their names longer, and propagated them farther than the wiſeſt of the worlds Philoſophers, and the nobleſt Princes and Potentates thereof? And yet how few are there who contend ſo zealouſly for this, as the other?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For what are all arts or ſciences, or powers, or pleaſures, or profits unſanctified, or unſeaſoned by Religion, but ſo many inſtruments of wickedneſſes, couſenages, and villanies? And what are all humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Polities but ſo many ſhops of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, deceits, and uncontroulable rapine and ſpoil without Religion influencing the conſcience and regulating the Actions of Men? For without this, no ſuch Lawes can be enacted which may ſecure either the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of men from violence, or their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from injuries. And the advantage that ſome irreligious perſons make to themſelves by contemning Religious Rules, tends direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ruine of the Common body, or innumerable particular perſons. For one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59605:11"/> man having no ſenſe or conſcience of God and the fear due to him, corrupts wines and other drinks, with ſome benefit to himſelfe, and great prejudice to the bodies of many more: others falſyfie ſtuffes, ſilks and cloaths, and deceive the wearer: others counterfeit lawfull money, contrary to the Standard; and bring dammage to their neighbours, and often loſſe of life and goods to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Others defraud in weights and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; others emboldened by gainfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in unjuſt practices, caſt off wholly the very vizor of Conſcience and Religion, and with open face rob and ſpoile their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and in concluſion bring confuſion to themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Theſe are indeed lamentable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of an irreligious mind; but how much more to be lamented and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are the corruptions and waſts made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inward man, by the want of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? How hereupon doe as well mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous as pernicious dogmes invade the underſtanding, and miſlead it into many idle, fooliſh, falſe, and abſurd paradoxes? And theſe prevailing, how are the affections ſet at liberty to run into all manner of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities, and ſophiſticate the powers of the Soule; more criminall in the account of God, than corrupting the Kings coin, or defacing maliciouſly his Image can be with men:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59605:12"/> more prejudicial to man himſelfe than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blindneſſe of the eyes, mutilation of members, or lameneſſe of limbs: as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teaches, when he tells us, it is better to goe to heaven without a right eye or right hand, than having ſuch iutegrity of bodily parts to be caſt into hell, for want of true Religion. But becauſe ſuch as want Religion are leaſt of all ſenſible of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and inevident evills preached againſt wanters of Religion, it may not be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to bring down the Appeal againſt them to their ſenſes and outward obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may inform us what havock irreligion makes upon mens perſons and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conditions, bringing their wits into ſuſpicion of weakneſs; who to appear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body in dogmatizing, are conſtrained to take up the oppoſing the received principles of Religion: an extraordinary ſubject draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens ears to liſten after ſuch a vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher; whom otherwayes no man would regard talking and walking according to the known Rules of ſobriety, and piety, through the defects of reaſon, ayming at no greater glory, than thoſe obſcure and pittifull fellowes of little or no place or power conſiderable, who to acquire ſomewhat of a name, provoke and ſet upon invincible Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, or chooſe to periſh by a Royal hand.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59605:12"/>
                  <p n="7">7. And muſt not the portion of reaſon be very weak and low in him, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the oppugning that which ſo many before him have attempted without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther event than their own infamy and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity after a wilfull oppoſing the once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved truth? For ſo impregnable is the Rock of Religion, that it could never be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd conſiderably by any aſſaults; nor ſo far ſunck or loſt to the view and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, by the leaden weights of mens ratiocinations, but it <hi>buoy'd</hi> it ſelf up above all ſuch enemies, and triumphed over them, while the names and memory of its adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries rotted, and their own deeds contrary to Religion oppreſs'd them in their vices, and confounded them. So that delighting not to know God, but holding the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, ſtupendous infatuations have ſeized upon many of their mindes and diſturbed their affections, that not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that they call Religion, but to that we and they both call Nature, they have corrupted and abuſed themſelves, ſo that ſuch things as they would not underſtand, in proceſſe of time they cannot; and thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſeemed unreaſonable and brutiſh once to themſelves, become their ſupreme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in which they glory, and perhaps periſh.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59605:13"/>
                  <p n="8">8. Theſe miſchiefs then foreſeen; and the contrary benefits of Religion diſcerned and believed, put me upon the deſigne of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> deſiring men to ſuffer a word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that they would be reconciled to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſometimes magnified by them in word, but not ſo often allowed of in practice; to God, and to Religion, and to Chriſt Jeſus bringing ſalvation unto all men; whereby they can only be happy. And that they would not here expect demonſtrations to compell them to come into the Faith, nor eloquence to perſwade them, (not pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to here) but the ſimplicitie of the truth, and the power of Godlineſſe, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of minde and conſcience, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be attained; and the unſpeakable happineſſe believed and expected hereafter, may ſuffice to awaken divers to enquire ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, whether theſe things be ſo; as good <hi>Bereans;</hi> which will eaſily appear to every unprejudiced minde, under this great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage above worldly doctrines, that none of theſe have ſo much as dar'd to promiſe ſo great future bleſſings in a world to come; nor have any made good ſuch fair promiſes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happineſſe in this world; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo many have been charmed with and unhappily truſted to, and been deluded by.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But yet I would not be here ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if I intended to inſiſt upon the

                  <p n="1">1. THE ſeeds of Religion being ſown in the heart by God himſelfe, and ſome ſmaller and dimmer ſtrictures caſt into man by the ſame hand directing man to God, it is the duty of every one to improve the ſame by orderly progreſſions to the meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59605:14"/> 
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. To this end Antiquity (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out competent grounds in Holy Scripture) hath pitched upon three more conſiderable ſtates of a Chriſtian, and aſcents of the Soul towards God by Religion, though not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, yet neceſſary to Salvation. For Saint <hi>Johns</hi> words, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 12, 13, 14. ſeem to tend to this, diſtinguiſhing little Children, Young Men and Old Men: or Beginners, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients, and Perfect, not ſo abſolute as God may not finde fault with, yet ſo as before man they may be irreprehenſible, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable by God, according to the ſcantlings and infirmities of Fleſh and Blood. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to this, <hi>Caſſian</hi> in his Collations, with ſome others, have obſerved that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> wrote three Books: One for inſtruction and illumination in wiſdome, which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> initiating young beginners in the knowledge and fear of God, which is there called <hi>the beginning of Wiſdome, and good underſtanding;</hi> laying the foundation to eternal Life. The other Book of <hi>Solomon</hi> called <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the eye and underſtanding the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world, and the pollutions of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyes, with a tacite diſſwaſion from the uſe of them, to the diſhonour of God: which performed introduceth a man to the third and laſt degree of perfection in this world, contemplation of God and divine matters,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59605:14"/> whereby ſuch a ſenſation of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo far wrought in the Soule, that it becometh united more entirely with God; which we call the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitive</hi> way: and ſeems to be figured out to us by that <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led commonly <hi>Solomons.</hi> And this threefold Cord binding the Soule to God, ſeemeth to have ſome little inſinuation made to us from the wiſdome of the world, the Ancient Pythagoreans teaching three manner of wayes of attaining happineſſe, Labour and Action about Vertue: Meditation conducting to Knowledge of God, and Love of God, which is the true conjunction of the Soule with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such concurrence then there being of divine and humane wiſdome to juſtifie ſuch a partition of Religion, no wonder that the reputed <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Areopagite took hold of ſuch an occaſion given to him to commend this tripartite doctrine of the Illuminative, Purgative, and Unitive way of ſerving God; in which many have imitated him, and much; and perhaps too far advanced it. From whom I take the libertie ſo far to varie as to make Illumination the foundation and firſt ſtep to all regular aſcent to Godward, as proceeding from that faith which is the foundation of all Chriſtian graces. For by it, we come to have the eyes of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding opened, and judge our ſelves, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59605:15"/> purge our ſelves, and fit our ſelves for an higher and neerer conjunction with God, as will appear more fully hereafter.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. Of the neceſſitie and uſe of Illumination: and of Faith with its ſubordinate graces, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conducing thereunto.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. FAmous is the diſtinction of St. <hi>Paul</hi> of Theologicall Vertues into Faith, Hope, and Charitie, as of them upon which all other Chriſtian duties and vertues are founded and move towards that perfection competible to believers in this life. Faith illuminating, Hope purging, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or love of God uniting us unto God. For the naturall man is blinde and cannot ſee afar off, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> teaches us. And na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we all lye polluted in our blood, and ſo naturally are aliens from God and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable by any other name or meanes but that of Chriſt Jeſus, in whome to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is to know God and our ſelves. For as the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 19. 2. <hi>That the ſoule ſhould be without knowledge, is not good.</hi> Faith with Chriſtians begetteth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge properly divine in Chriſtians, being the light and eye both of the ſoule regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59605:15"/> So that, as it is not poſſible for the blinde man to work any curious work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of his eyes, but every act tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that way, muſt be a fault and errour (For how can it be expected that any man ſhould ſew well that cannot thread his needle) ſo they on whom the light of the Goſpell ſhineth not, who are not enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The firſt thing that God produced in creating the world was light; not that he abſolutely needed it, but that the creatures did; and to intimate unto us the order of true Regeneration; that it muſt begin with Illumination. And therefore God who more immediately of old revealed himſelfe to his choſen ſervants, did, in following ages ſet up and fix a light in his Church, the written word of God, which received by faith ſhould become a conſtant Guide to our Feet and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne to our Pathes, paſſing through this dark Vale towards the Mount and true City of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For without this the Philoſophers of this world profeſſing themſelves (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Rom,</hi> 1. 22.) wiſe, became fools: er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the very firſt ſtep and prime principle of divine knowledge; which teaches the only true God: they for their part, in groping after God, changing the glorie of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible God into an Image made like unto corruptible man: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> allſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59605:16"/> 
                     <hi>v.</hi> 23. which is much the ſame as to turne the image or very ſubſtance of man into God. But when it pleaſed God that the Day-ſtar ſhould ariſe in our hearts, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, which is Chriſt revealed to the world and minds of men: and when as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, ſhined in our hearts, to give us the light of the knowledge of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then did the ſhadowes of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance flee away. Holy <hi>David</hi> having foretold of this, when he ſaid, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36. <hi>In thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> So that as Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>He that gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with me ſcattereth:</hi> in like manner may it truly be ſaid, Whoſo enlighteneth not with, by, and from him darkeneth: as it happened to thoſe ſubtile and wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants, <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends, <hi>Job</hi> 38. who darkened counſell by words without knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And too near do they approach to the like errour, who darkening of late the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith and the uſe of it, imagine the ſtrong perſwaſion they have of the goodneſſe of God and Grace of Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the great end of light and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and that the Inſtrument whereby they ſhould work, is the work it ſelf, to be performed by them, and ſuch in which a man might acquieſce; as having fulfill'd the whole
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59605:16"/> Will of God; and thereupon entertain ſuch a perſwaſion of himſelfe, that infallibly he ſhall be ſaved, while he remains very deficient in the common and known duties of a true Chriſtian: miſtaking the true notion and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Faith, which is not ſo much to teach us what we are our ſelves, but what God is, and what is his Will, and what our dutie is to him, and the effects of obedience, and holy life preſcribed by him: So that juſtifying and ſaving faith, is Godlineſs in the power of it, and Godlineſſe in the power, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, is a Confluence of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Graces and Vertues, the principall of which are reckoned up by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where he counſelleth, 2 Epiſt. 1, 5, 6. to <hi>Adde to faith, vertue; and to vertue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and to patience, godlineſſe; and to godlineſſe, brotherly kindeneſſe; and to brotherly kindneſſe, Charitie:</hi> And having profited ſo far as to be poſſeſſed of ſuch Graces, to ſtrive, as the ſame Apoſtle hath it, to abound in the ſame; which having competently attained unto, gives the beſt aſſurance of the good purpoſe of our heavenly Father, to give us the Kingdome promiſed to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But the preſumptuous and prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous faith whereby men are prone to phanſie themſelves into the higheſt favour of God,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59605:17"/> before they have paſſed through the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Faith, which is labourſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to Fleſh, is that which leadeth men into blindneſſe of minde, and perhaps per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in the midſt of ſtrong perſwaſions of the contrary, our Saviour Chriſt teaching us ſo much, where he ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Which of you having a ſervant plowing or feeding cattle will ſay unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Goe and ſit down to meat, And will not rather ſay unto him, Make ready wherewith I may ſuppe, and gird thy ſelfe and ſerve me, and afterward thou ſhalt eat and drink.</hi> Which teaches us, that it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not preſently to take up our reſt of aſſurance of our ſalvation by faith ſpeciall, ſo ſoon as we are called home to God from the wide and wild converſation in the field of this world, but muſt yet farther attend the ſervice God hath for us to doe, and then to expect his farther favour of an eternall reſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And becauſe, amongſt various accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in holy Scripture of the word Faith, it is ſometimes uſed for the Grace of faith, and ſometimes for the works and fruits of faith, every prudent and pious Chriſtian muſt be very carefull that he puts not ſuch a fallacie upon himſelfe as to inferre to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the whole vertue of faith taken in its full latitude, upon ſome particular branch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59605:17"/> thereof found in him: crouding all duties of pietie into one, and that rather a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto true, religious life, than the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of it, ſuch as knowing and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and the meanes thereunto tending, reading and hearing of Gods holy word. For being well initiated in thoſe neceſſarie principles and helps of devotion, there ſo to ſtop, or in them to improve, that acts of faith, hope, and charitie ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, overthrowes the whole deſign of faith it ſelfe: whereof no ſmall part is to confeſſe our ſins, to repent heartily and thorowly, to attend to good works, and acts of mercie, to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance: and not to think to commute with God; that when he requires private or publique worſhip, we ſhould think it as well and perhaps better, to read cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chapters in the Bible, or to be preſent and heare a Sermon: and when God calls to performe good deeds of Charitie in viſiting the ſick, and being at charges for the relief of the poor, to exceed in reading and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuppoſing ſuch cheaper parts of ſplendid profeſſion, will anſwer all obligations to God and our neceſſitous neighbour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is one principall point of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Illumination by faith, to underſtand what it teacheth us by the Apoſtle, ſaying, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Stand perfect and compleat
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59605:18"/> in all the will of God;</hi> to the effecting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Faith is ordained and given us by God, as a tool and Engine, not as the work it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And therefore the ancient and more experienced Father we read of, handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely reproved the miſtakes of three well inclined novices in the ſounder part of Piety, when the Firſt declaring the courſe of his <hi>Life,</hi> ſaid with expectation of applauſe, I have got the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament by heart. Then, ſaid the Old man, thou haſt poured out many words into the air: intending he ſhould underſtand, that all that was to very ſmall purpoſe without proportionable acts of holineſſe. And the Second ſaid, I have wrote over all the Old and New Teſtament with mine own hand. Then (ſaid the ancient Father,) thou haſt filled thy windowes with ſtore of paper. And the third glorying that the graſſe grew on his hearth; implying how much cold and hunger he had ſuffered; was anſwered by the ſame perſon, Then haſt thou driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way hoſpitality; intimating, that no man abounding in ſome good duties muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe that he ſhall thereby make compenſation for ſuch defects in other graces willfully neglected: being better informed from St. <hi>Paul</hi> that knowledge, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves were entruſted with us by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59605:18"/> God <hi>that the man of God may be perfect, and thorowly furniſhed unto all Good workes,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. And as <hi>Davids</hi> practice was, <hi>to have an eye to all Gods commands,</hi> without exception, or limitation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Againſt this if it chances to be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (what vulgarly is ſaid) that there is no perfection in this world: we may anſwer without great difficulty, That perfection there is in the Scriptures themſelves, and Chriſtian Religion above what is to be found in any other Authours, Sciences or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There is a perfection of integritie or of parts, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon</hi> ver. 6. calleth, Communication of faith becoming effectuall by the acknowledging of every good thing, ſo that not one vertue or dutie preſcribed to a true Chriſtian muſt be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true believer, however the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of thoſe vertues may be, and generally are imperfect. And yet again, having in ſome degree been initiated into all Chriſtian vertues, we are not there to reſt as if we had alreadie attained the end of Religion, but muſt proſecute thoſe mean, yet good beginnings till we arrive to that pitch which God hath not revealed unto us, that he will accept to our juſtification and ſalvation; but only have a ſound, firme, and comfortable Hope of the Favour of God, which ſome are pleaſed in theſe laſt ages, to call Faith
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59605:19"/> juſtifying: But faith properly ſo called hath for its object truth, and that as relating to all men: but Hope hath for its object, Good; and that as pertaining to particular perſons; of which nature is the perſwaſion we have of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Good as truely belonging unto us: and thereby, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>We aſſure our hearts before him.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. IT is a common and uſefull diſtinction of Faith by the Learned, not difficult to be underſtood by the unlearned, into the matter or articles of our Faith propounded to our aſſent by God himſelfe in his Word; and the Gift and Grace of Faith enabling us to believe things ſo revealed, and neceſſary to our Salvation. It will be therefore very expedient for the better informing every plain and ſincere capacity, to make ſome recitall of thoſe things our Faith Chriſtian is founded upon, and which we are to believe, and that principally by Revelation: and not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59605:19"/> wholly to be ſilent herein any more than St. <hi>Luke</hi> was in writing his Goſpell, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 1. <hi>For as much as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order thoſe things which are moſt ſurely believed amongſt us:</hi> becauſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall formes and phraſes may help towards the ſame ſenſe and end of believing, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And here firſt of all is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and believed the great Prerogative of Chriſtian Religion above all other diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries made to Man: when our Saviour Chriſt in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, Ch. 11. v. 25. <hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe, and revealed them to babes.</hi> Not that Chriſt maligned the knowledge of theſe things to others; but that he admired the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges conferred by God upon his mean flock. And what theſe things are, and how, and to whom, revealed, St. <hi>Paul</hi> certifies us, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, ſaying, <hi>Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdome among them that are perfect, yet not the wiſdome of this world which cometh to naught; but we ſpeak the wiſdome of God in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, even the hidden wiſdome, which God ordained before the world to our glory—For God hath revealed them by his Spirit. For the Spirit ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God.</hi> Meaning hereby to teach us, that whatever knowledge man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59605:20"/> may attain to in the ſearch of the myſteries of Nature, Revelation is abſolutely neceſſarie to the knowledge of the deep things of Gods counſell and pleaſure concerning his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Being, and our ſervice of him, and ſalvation by him, diſcovery ſhould be. made unto us, ſome other way than by our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon, darkened by our own apoſtaſie and infatuations. So that the whole Bible may be called one entire book of divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations: the <hi>Jew</hi> having received many things from God which were denied unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Chriſtian having received from God more clear diſpenſations and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime than were granted unto the <hi>Jew,</hi> for he beheld things as in a glaſſe darkly, but the other, face to face; that is, the very things themſelves, and not the darker ſhadowes, which were to flee away at the riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſſe: which is by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle called, <hi>the Myſterie of Chriſt:</hi> which in other ages was not made known unto the ſons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy Apoſtles and Prophets by the Spirit. Whereupon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Ep. 1. 5. tells us of Gods Elect, that they are <hi>kept by the power of God through faith, unto Salvation, readie to be revealed in the laſt times:</hi> which laſt times were the ſame of which the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks, that in the laſt dayes God hath ſpoken unto us by his Son: and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59605:20"/> thoſe laſt dayes were the dayes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell revealing the myſteries of Godlineſſe unto us: and not theſe laſt dayes phanſied by ſome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now, notwithſtanding innumerable are the divine documents and notices extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily deliver'd through the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and more eſpecially there be a fair Catalogue given us <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. of the ſingular vertues and uſes of Faith in revealing divine things, yet becauſe we now ſpeak chiefly to babes in Chriſt, or St. <hi>Johns</hi> Little children, it may not be amiſſe to aſſiſt the weaker, without offence of the ſtronger, in giving ſome ſpeciall inſtances whereby the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a green Chriſtian is either actually improved, or improveable to a greater degree than can readily be found in aliens from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There have been, in former years, ſome leading men in the Reformation and learned, who have collected ten ſeverall and conſiderable grounds in which all Religions concurre, and this was the ingenious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of <hi>Bibliander:</hi> ſince which, divers with tolerable deſigne, but I fear with no good event at all, but rather the contrary, have in theſe very late years, written about Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Religion, and the Reaſonableneſſe of Chriſtian Faith manifeſted by naturall Light: hoping it may be, to begett a better
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59605:21"/> opinion in many rank Rationaliſts, of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; but perhaps they conſidered not what evill conſequence followes from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> that the very firſt principle of our Chriſtian faith is hereby weakened, and more ſlighted; as judged from hence, not to be ſo neceſſary as commonly is received. For Revelations divine, and that theſe writings we call Scriptures, are divinely revealed, is the moſt fundamentall part of our Religion: which to make credible by ſundrie Topicks of reaſon, have been alwaies the practice of the Ancients, as it is ſtill of the moderne, not illaudable: but to offer demonſtrations, and thoſe ſuch upon which they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain belief of that firſt principle, is to cauſe the whole fabrick of Chriſtian faith to reſt on that tottering and unſtable foundation; and of divine, to dilute our faith into hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perſwaſion; all ſuperiour articles of our faith having no ſtronger ſtay than ſuch a bottome will allow them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And I muſt confeſſe, for my part, I am ſo far from being pleaſed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Golden ſayings of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or the divine ſentences of <hi>Plato, Seneca,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that moderner vapourer, or rather vapour it ſelfe, <hi>Hierocles,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napius</hi> preſents unto us, that they rather turne my ſtomach at their aemulation of Chriſtian perfection, thereby to leſſen the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59605:21"/> value of Chriſtian Religion it ſelfe, than draw me to affecting or admiring them. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. 14. tells us, 'tis <hi>By faith we ſtand:</hi> and again, that our faith it ſelfe ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdome of men but in the power of God. And it will be found by experience, that humane reaſon thus coming officiouſly to the aid of divine Faith, unable to ſatisfie the doubting minde about the doctrine proper to Faith, will in the end, prove ſo ſawcie and domineering as to give law to faith, and like Ivie which clings to the tree for a ſubſiſtence, will weaken it and ſuck out the heart of it, in time. Herein therefore conſiſteth the very ſoule, or (as ſcholaſticall men ſpeak) the very formall reaſon of Chriſtian faith illuminating other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than the humane Lights of this world, that we believe what we have not ſeen by ſence, nor learned by experience, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scriptures we now are poſſeſſed of, are the Revelations which God hath given us for our inſtruction and direction in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, and holy converſation before him and the world.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now from this foundation laid, this principle granted, this fountain of all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wiſdome and underſtanding opened, doe iſſue all particular branches of our faith il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating us: ſome few of which articles reduced into the three eminent Creeds of all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59605:22"/> Chriſtian Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> The Apoſtolicall, the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian,</hi> which may yet be more plainly and vulgarly thus ordered, to eaſie capacities.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt that there is a God: and this God but one in nature and ſubſtance; of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, eternal, immutable Being; and there is, or can poſſibly be no more; number herein deſtroying all perfection proper to the divine Being: which article, though ſome of the wiſe Naturaliſts did give their cold aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, yet ſcarce ever ſo, but they tolerated ſuch opinions and religions of others as maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary; feeling rather, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles phraſe is, after God, than finding him, or holding him faſt by ſuch a ſtrong faith as Chriſtians are and muſt be indued with: knowing aſſuredly, that Religion, and our Salvation receive by no one ſuperſtition, ſo deadly a blow, and deſtructive to all ſound Chriſtianity, as to erre about this firſt principle, by acknowledging directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, more than one God: that is, either in the Propoſition, profeſſing more than one, (which totally ſubverts Chriſtianity) or in Practice, worſhipping that for God which is not God, though under a ſtrong perſwaſion, that what we worſhip is that one true God; and though in mind and intention we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to worſhip only the true God. For ſuch a fact upon involuntarie errour (and all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59605:22"/> is ſaid by wiſe men to be involuntarie) may mitigate the offence before God and man, but it cannot at all change the thing it ſelfe; making that to be no idolatrie which is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie; or that no hereſie which is hereſie in it ſelfe, but only by certain circumſtance may alleviate (and yet we know not how little or much) the crime of the offender: which crime is in it ſelfe directly damnable, and ſo by the doctrine of our Chriſtian faith to be reputed, and even with the loſſe of our lives to be avoided.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And the ſame faith likewiſe teacheth us, as neceſſary to ſalvation, to believe aright of the ſeverall and diſtinct wayes of the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the Deitie in the Trinity of the perſons: which we commonly call, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; which, as we muſt believe to be three, and not one Perſon, ſo muſt we believe to be one in nature and ſubſtance, and not three: ſo that the Father begetteth the Son, and is not begotten of any: and the Son is begotten of the Father by an Eternall and incorrupt generation, not to be parallel'd in any other productions, though dimly repreſented unto us. And the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Son; by ſuch a divine emanation as is not imitable by any created proceſſion. And in this article of our Faith, Chriſtians being wholly deſtitute of all naturall aſſiſtance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59605:23"/> to believe, the whole muſt redound to the power and pleaſure of God revealing theſe things, and rendering them credible, our faith upon that ground receiving them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And a third point of our Faith proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to reunite, as it were, in our mindes and perſwaſions, thoſe perſons we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to ſtand ſo diſtinguiſhed by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall Relations mentioned, in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward operations, ſuch as are acts of Creation, Preſervation and Governing, by a moſt wiſe and juſt providence, all things which are in this viſible world, and in that or thoſe worlds which are to us inviſible, called Celeſtiall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And hence it is that, by the ſame faith, we are taught more expreſſely and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that the One God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt gave a being to all the world, and out of nothing, produced what we ſee, and what we underſtand, and more than we can behold and apprehend; determining that knottie controverſie which the Philoſophers could make no work with, concerning the Creation of the world, which ſome would have never to have been, but ſubſiſting from eternitie of it ſelfe: and not only ſo, but we underſtand by divine Revelation and Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how the world was made: and that not by the contriving of the brain, or a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell laid before the eyes, or by the labour of the hand, the ſweat of the face, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59605:23"/> but neceſſarie toyl of many dayes, years, or ages; but by the lighteſt and eaſieſt way we could poſſibly underſtand any thing to be wrought; For thus we read <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>Through faith we underſtand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen were not made of things which do appear:</hi> And ſo we read <hi>Pſalm</hi> 33. 6. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth:</hi> And yet not ſo by the word or mouth of God, as that any ſuch part is to be admitted in God, or that properly God ſo ſpake vocally, (For to what, or whom ſhould God ſpeak ſo, when there was no bodie, yea nothing to hear) but it was a mere, ſimple, pure velleity, or willing of him, ſo effectuall as to produce the Univerſe, without the labour of his hands, or of any other Agent or Inſtrument under him, as ſome have vainlie imagined, contrary to our divine Faith. For by the ſame power that God could create a worme, he could create an Elephant, and with the ſame eaſe that he could create a Mite, he might create the hugeſt Monſter that ever the earth bare; yea, the earth it ſelfe: and that without delaies; or diſtances of times; though, to ſhew his libertie and not neceſſity of working, and to teach us adviſedneſſe in all our Actions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, he vouchſafed to diſtribute his acts
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59605:24"/> into ſeverall orders, and ſpaces of duration, called Dayes. For (as 'tis ſaid) in ſix dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, and all that is therein, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And from this generall working or acting of God, we are lead to an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree more nearly concerning our ſelves. For it muſt neceſſarily follow from hence, that, as the Pſalmiſt affirmeth, <hi>He hath made us, and not we our ſelves,</hi> Pſalm 95. And that as he made all things very good; ſo the more noble in rank ſuch things were, the more perfect and unblameable they muſt needs be, as they came out of Gods hands. For God doth not work or proceed after the manner of nature from imperfect to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as all naturall productions are ill form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defective at firſt, and in tract of time ariſe to their ordained perfection: but God made all things, and eſpecially Man, at once; moſt perfect, both as to inward endowments and outward forme, ſtature, and parts: ſo that nothing was wanting either to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of his minde, or the perfection of his bodie, Crowning both with holineſſe and happineſſe immortal: wherein his own Image and likeneſſe principally conſiſted; adding unto them here in this life, power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion under him over all earthly things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6, Furhermore the ſame faith teacheth us the Original of the ſoule or ſpirit of man,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59605:24"/> which was variouſly canvaſed by the wiſe men of this world, without reſolution ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie, and that he, and not naturall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was the true cauſe thereof, and that Chriſt and his Father worketh hitherto, and he worketh, <hi>John</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seventhly, we learne from holy Writ, concerning the government of the World, that God leadeth not ſuch a ſedentarie and careleſſe life as ſome Philoſophers imagined, after the manner of many Great Men, who build fair and ſtately Houſes and furniſh them richly, but ſo leave them to fall to decay, and the things therein to be loſt and ſpoiled, neither doth he trouble his head or vex his heart (as ſome men doe) about the management of their Houſes and Lands, but by a mean way of ſufficient protection and providence, diſpoſes all things, even Good and Evill, ſo wiſely and harmoniouſly, that no moleſtation is given to himſelfe, nor any damage to the Univerſe it ſelfe, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable changes are conſtantly wrought to the detriment of ſome particulars there, and the like advantage to other things not before noted. So that what, for its time, lay hid and contemptible, is raiſed, as it were, out of the duſt, and exalted to greatneſſe and ſplendour; and for a ſeaſon having ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, by the ſame all-diſpoſing hand relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into its ancient obſcurity, and this by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59605:25"/> viciſſitude which ſome times an Age or two declareth; ſome times, not many Centuries of years. And by the ſame Faith we according to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Doctrine, 2 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. 7. underſtand that as the heavens and earth were formed and ſtood out of the waters, ſo the heavens and the earth which are now, by the ſame word are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire againſt the day of Judgement.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. By Faith likewiſe we know that the fine and admirable Maſterpiece of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Man, created in the foreſaid perfection, and being in great honour and happineſſe, through his own folly (as did the Angels before him) fell from his ſtedfaſtneſſe into blindeſſe, povertie, and generall miſerie of bodie and minde: contracting thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of affections inward, and diſeaſes and death outward, the ſeeds of all which he tranſmitted to his poſterity, and is that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne all are infected and infeſted with. This the Learning of this world could hardly, or not at all inſtruct us in, but is the office of our faith to inform us: From whence alſo we can only give account of the many and ſtrange exorbitances of our minde, and the ſeverall infirmities, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and pains of our bodie before our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon comes to that ripeneſſe as to entitle us to the guilt of erroneous actions, or free ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Good and Evill.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. Neither could humane learning or books of the greateſt Philoſophers informe us, how, tied and bound in the chain of our ſins, and fallen into the depth of common deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhould recover our loſſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair our breaches; neither could we our ſelves deviſe any more than we could really deſire to evade the evils we were ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with: But that light from above which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world, ſheweth that God out of the Abyſſe of his Counſells and freeneſſe of his Grace and Love towards Mankinde, firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the redemption of him, and when the fullneſſe of time was come, actually ſent his Son into the world in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinfull fleſh, to condemn ſin in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And this Salvation was ratified to man, ſoon after his fall; God entring then into a new Covenant with man to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſtating him into his favour, and reſtoring him to the bleſſed hopes of ſalvation eternall, upon Evangelicall faith, and obedience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable thereunto. And that theſe termes of this Covenant may, as well as ought, be performed on mans part, though not upon his own ſtrength, is a materiall point of our faith, and a prime motive to our obedience. For were it not, that man bounden thus to God, might come up to that degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59605:26"/> as to be judged by God to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what is neceſſary to obtaining the promiſes made by God, no wiſe man would trouble himſelfe to begin ſuch an impoſſible work; and no faithfull man or true believer could be ſure of his ſalvation, as is often taught we may and ought to be: but rather every man may be ſure of his damnation, knowing thar he can in no wayes doe that upon which his ſalvation depends.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Furthermore, It is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed tells us) that we believe rightly the Incarnation of out Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who by taking fleſh of the Virgin Mary his Mother, unto the divine nature, became an apt and ſufficient Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour between God and Man; and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratour of the New Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And this adminiſtration was wrought two wayes principally: Firſt, by the divine doctrine and knowledge revealed unto the world, delivered by himſelfe, and his elect ſervants to that end inſpired extraordinarily; and contained in the ſeverall Books of the New Teſtament. Secondly, by his Paſſion and death upon the Croſſe, as a Lamb of God offered for the ſins of the whole world, in which God reſted ſatisfied, and became appeaſed; and Believers had acceſſe to the throne of Grace, and became accepted in the beloved.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. But to the effectuall application of ſo glorious a benifit as this, is ſomewhat more required of all true Believers than a Faith paſſive; it being neceſſarie that firſt we ſhould uſe the meanes ordained by God to that great end, before we can have any ſound hope of attaining the ſame. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing faith preceding, the ſumme of what remains and to which other duties may be reduc'd, may be three fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The uſe of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, inſtituted as a laver of regeneration, and a forme of initiation into the Covenant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we are of the number of Infidells, and aliens from the Common wealth of Iſrael, and without hope of ſalvation, and in our ſins, and naturall blindneſſe, which hereby was ſo cured that the newly baptiſed were ſaid in Scripture to be illuminated or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 32.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And unto this comes in, as an Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary improving and perfecting the low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of thoſe once initiated, to an high degree of holineſſe and comfort, The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper ordained by Chriſt to the ratification of our Covenant entered into with God, and the memorie of Chriſts paſſion and death upon the Croſſe for us, and our being more ſtrictly and intimately united to Chriſt; as ſhall hereafter be more fullie declared.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. A third moſt neceſſary and effectuall meanes of applying Chriſts merits to us, is that excellent gift of God, as the Scripture termes it, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of which (with the concomitants of it likewiſe) we may ſpeak farther hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Of the Reſurrection likewiſe of the bodie, and the reuniting of the ſoule unto it: and upon ſuch reſtauration, the receiving of the proper reward of Good and Evill done now in the body, is another article of our faith not demonſtrable by the wiſdome of this world, but diſcerned by Revelation.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. To this likewiſe appertains the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which Faith teacheth us of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt in glorie and Juſtice, to be the Great Judge of Quick and Dead; bringing his reward with him: ſo that they who have done good ſhall goe into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and they that have done evill, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Laſtly, as the nerve and bond of our Faith, we are by Gods Holy Word taught aſſuredly; that God hath two Cities or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties in this world of his own Conſtitution, and not framed by the will or power of Man. The one is that Civill Government, wherein God hath ſet his Delegates to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order and unitie, by the due admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice: to whom men are to be ſubject, as the Miniſters of God, ſent to thoſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59605:27"/> ends. The other is the Church of Chriſt, or companie of true Believers, of whom Chriſt is the ſupreme Head: <hi>From whom the whole bodie fitly joyned together and compacted by that which every joynt ſupplyeth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the effectuall working in the meaſure of every part, maketh increaſe of the bodie, unto the edifying it ſelfe in love, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 16. And it being impoſſible that Faith it ſelfe ſhould ſubſiſt long, the Church being diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and it not being poſſible the Church ſhould not be diſſolved, where there is no order of Superiour and Inferiour; nor poſſible that ſuch order ſhould be preſerved without ſubjection and obedience, the Catholique Church is to be believed to be holy, and obeyed as our Guide and Governour, and ſo is every particular Church managed by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſucceeding Paſtours, to be reverenced and obeyed: untill ſuch time that they, or it be convicted of ſome groſſe errour, and defection from Chriſt; and not only till all exceptions made againſt them be reſolved to our mindes. So that enviouſly and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe that Hierarchy inſtituted by Chriſt, or the precepts delivered by them for the conſervation of the Bodie in faith and worſhip of God, is to reſiſt God and not man, and to make themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious for officiouſneſſe without authority received of God, to ſhame and perdition.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59605:28"/>
                  <p n="5">5. And this Abſtract of knowledge given us by God in his Revealed Word, I held very requiſite to premiſe, as the grounds of our Chriſtian faith, and as ſo many inſtances of his ſingular favour to his Elect ones, in diſcovering unto them ſuch myſteries as the Princes of this world were and are ignorant of: and we might walke worthy of ſuch light given us. And to theſe of a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nature might we adde thoſe of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall order; whereby God doth teach us above the doctrines of men, not only not to commit ſuch things which are diſhoneſt, unjuſt, unreaſonable, filthy, and the like, but not ſo much as to deſire them: and that inward concupiſcence of evill is a ſin condemned by God, however tolerated by humane Lawes; either becauſe they doe not actually break the peace of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or becauſe ſuch cloſe iniquities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come under the cognizance of humane judicature: But God ſearcheth the heart, and tryeth the reins, and judges the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoule, as our faith tells us: The ſumme of which knowledge is given us by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 7. when, as learned as he was, he tells us, <hi>I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> So that from hence we may diſcerne the truth of what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the ſoule;

                  <head>SECT. V. Of the Grace and Act of Faith leading to Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination: and of the difficulties and means of believing.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NOW we proceed to the ſecond ſenſe of Faith, mentioned before; and that is, the Grace or Gift, or both, by which we believe: or the next diſpoſition of the minde towards Illumination. For as it is in nature, ſo likewiſe is it in the caſe of Religion. To him that is naturally blinde and diſcerneth nothing, exteriour objects are in themſelves as viſible, as they are to him who hath the perfect uſe of his eyes, and ſeeth all things duly offered to his ſight; but the indiſpoſition of the organe hindereth the exerciſe of the ſame. So we finde that what is preſented alike to all mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and faith, hath not the like effect upon men to apprehend or believe what is ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One reaſon whereof may well be that which our Catechiſme, directed by Gods holy Word, aſſures us of; <hi>viz.</hi> that we were borne in ſin; of which ſtate, blindneſſe is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part. So that as it ſeemed an incredible thing to the <hi>Jewes, John</hi> the 9th. that Chriſt ſhould open the eyes of him that was borne
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59605:29"/> blinde; may it ſeem one of the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties to us, that being ſo naturally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and averſe to ſpirituall things, we ſhould be cured of ſo great a maladie. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this doubt is given us by Chriſt himſelfe, in the ſame Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 39. ſaying, <hi>For judgement am I come into this world, that they who ſee not, might ſee: and that they who ſee, might be blinde.</hi> Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calleth himſelf <hi>the light of the world, John</hi> 5. 8. yea, and more than ſo, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. according to the teſtimonie given of him by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>He was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world:</hi> that is, all men that come into the world, and are enlightened, by him only they are enlightened.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And when it ſo falls out, that men are not the better for the light offered to them and ſhining before them, a reaſon thereof is to be fetched from themſelves,, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of their own will, and obſtinacie and obdurateneſſe in their naturall ſtate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts own judgement of the world, <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</hi> So that as it is written by <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> in the life of St. <hi>Martine,</hi> that being endued with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous gift or faculty of curing ſick and impotent perſons, The blinde, and lame, and decrepit, who got their living by begging,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59605:30"/> were affraid of him and would not come near him, leſt being cured of ſuch their defects and impotencies, they ſhould loſe their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood. In like manner, many getting a miſerable and beggarly livelihood by ſerving and complying with the world, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinde and crippled in an heavenly ſenſe, refuſe that light, and life, and renovation which Chriſt bringeth with him. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof we have in the miniſtrie of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> preaching to the <hi>Athenians</hi> prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and captivated with worldly wiſdome, and thereupon ſaying; <hi>Thou bringeſt ſtrange things to our eares:</hi> In their judgements more ſtrange than true. And though it be Mannah it ſelfe, and that dropt down from heaven, for their edification and comfort; men, out of their ſcepticalneſſe and curioſitie, will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it, and perhaps in time, loath it; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that bread from heaven: there being generally too little agreement between the notions of half-ſighted naturall reaſon, and delectations of our ſenſes naturall, and the divine Revelations, and more ſpirituall preſcriptions given us by Religion: though naturall reaſon not counterfeited nor corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by baſer allayes of vitious men, may paſſe alſo as Gods true coyne. But that pure Gold it is not, which the Holy Ghoſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth us to buy, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3, 18. that we may be rich, and wherewith we may get white
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59605:30"/> raiment, that we may be clothed; that the ſhame of our nakedneſſe doe not appear; and get that eye-ſalve, that we may ſee; which is the word of God. For the knowledge or illumination which we have from thence, and that which we have from the Holy Spirit, differ no otherwiſe than that money a man carries about him, or that which the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath preſent in his Bank, and that which he hath in his Books, which muſt put him ſometimes to trouble to fetch in. The manner of which fetching in is by the Holy Spirit alſo, opening the heart that we may, (as the Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> after Chriſts Reſurrection) underſtand the Scriptures: untill which time that will be found too true which the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Cap. 8. 12. complains of in Gods behalf, <hi>I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to him the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But if we ſhould enquire faithfully into the grounds of ſuch incredulitie, and prejudice againſt Religion; we may finde them too often in the corrupt manners of men, influencing the underſtanding with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes and groſſe errours: which yet ſome to cover with ſhew of greateſt candour in judging, and ingenuity, have wiſhed they could believe the things Chriſtianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them. But if reality and common integritie be not alſo laid aſide here, how
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59605:31"/> eaſie a thing is it to reconcile them to the truth? For does not their own prime reaſon, and of all civilized People tell them that nothing truely humane is more naturall to Man than to be of ſome Religion? And yet if they be men but of indifferent reading and obſervation, they ſhall finde that there is no Religion, nor ever like to be, all whoſe Principles are obvious to all competent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings: And ſo conſequently, that men, to avoid the barbaritie of Atheiſme, muſt believe more than nature can compell them unto, by her philoſophicall demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or fall into an abſurditie little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Atheiſme, That every man ſhould frame his own Religion, and be ſo far religious as he thinks fit, and no farther; and which muſt neceſſarily follow, call his freak, and humour, his reaſon and judgement. So that it is ſcarce ſo true that a man cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the myſteries of Religion, as that he will not: and he will not, becauſe he dares not, for fear of the worſt. Or let it be that he cannot, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> (if he be but ſo far believed) ſaith of ſome, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>The God of this world</hi> (who that is I ſuppoſe is well known) <hi>hath blinded the mindes of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them:</hi> vain and vitious men having by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59605:31"/> wit, and evill lives, tempted evill Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits themſelves, and drawn them to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to their infatuations. For as every good and perfect gift cometh from above, from the Father of lights, as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, Chap. 1. 17. So doth everie notorious errour and wickedneſſe proceed from the Prince of darkneſſe, who ruleth in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deren of Diſobedience, they being called children of Diſobedience in Scripture, who obey not the Goſpell, nor believe it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly propounded.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But it may ſeem ſtrange and worth our wondering; How the ſame effect of blindneſſe of minde, ſhould be aſcribed to God; and alſo to the Devill, in Scripture: as <hi>John</hi> 12. 4. ſpeaking of God out of the Prophet <hi>Iſaias, He hath blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> This is in truth a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticall difficultie, which belongs to another place; to which I may referre it: but here I would have it obſerved, that as Judges or Princes are ſaid to put Malefactours to death when they doe it not themſelves, but deliver them over to the Executioner, whoſe office it is; ſo God, upon juſt provocation, delivering great Sinners to the Devill, may be ſaid to be a cauſe of their hardneſſe and blindneſſe, when it is cauſed directly by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59605:32"/> Satan only, and themſelves. But the true light of Faith, and life of Grace doth moſt properly appertain to God: as it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through faith, it is the gift of God.</hi> The reaſon whereof is, <hi>That the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.</hi> And this key of knowledge, which is alſo of the Kingdome of God did Chriſt deliver to his Apoſtles: by vertue of which, God aſſiſting, <hi>Lydia</hi>'s heart was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. And ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is the aſſiſtance of God in this caſe, that he ſeems to keep this key by his own ſide, and not at all times to lend it to his Miniſters; no not the Apoſtles. Nor did Chriſt himſelfe, (who as God had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of mens mindes) allwayes ſucceed in his teaching and exhortation, but, by I know not what deep providence, ſuffered his labours to be fruſtrated by the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of men. But this, we may ſay, falls out, by divine diſpenſation, that God may be all in all, in the beginning, continuing, and conſummation of every good work: and to repell that ſpirit of preſumption, whereby too proſperous Labourers in Gods Harveſt or Vineyard might be prone to attribute much more to themſelves, than comes to their ſhare.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For this reaſon God ſends ſuch tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dark weather at Sea to the skilfull Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigatour,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59605:32"/> that he ſhall not be able readily to know or ſay where he is, till the reſtored calme Light better informes him: And ſends Shipwracks ſometimes to the ſubtill Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that he may underſtand better who it is that gives skill and ſtrength to get Riches: And diappointeth the hopes of the underſtanding and painfull Husbandman. And as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 44. <hi>maketh diviners mad, and turneth wiſe men back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh,</hi> teaching them all, and us too, and that in all ſenſes, more perfectly that neceſſary leſſon of humility, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God. For it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, &amp;c.</hi> And as it is with the riches of this world, it is with the riches of the world to come, or being rich towards God, as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 21. For undoubtedly, God may, and doth apparently denie the ordinary meanes of Salvation, ſound knowledge, and holy faith in him, and of divine myſteries to ſome. To others he grants to be initiated, and to have ſome knowledge of the ſaving trueth; who there ſtop and proceed no farther, as tender plants riſing out of the earth wither, and periſh for want of the bleſſings of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven falling on them; without which they can proceed no farther towards perfection: and ſome proceed farther, and promiſe fair,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59605:33"/> and for the ſame reaſon attain not to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended end.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But nothing of this nature can reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably be taken into an Apologie or defence of the unprofitable ſervant, whom God hath delivered ſuch talents and meanes unto, that in themſelves tend unto ſuch progreſſions and conſummations as are ſaving and beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall. But admit thou art becalmed, and canſt make no way, through want of divine aſpirations and influence; How canſt thou? how dareſt thou impute this ceſſation and oſcitancie of thine, in not doing the known Will of God, unto an unknown cauſe, or rather, a not cauſe of doing: which whether it is ſo, as thou imagineſt, or giveſt out at leaſt that thou imagineſt, when thy heart contradicteth thy tongue, thou knoweſt not. For who can ſay, that God denies him the inward power and meanes of Salvation; that is of effectuall Grace, to whom he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the outward meanes of Illumination, Faith, and Salvation? Whatſoever may be wanting in the abſtruſe counſell and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations internall of God, and known to him, cannot be ſo known to a man without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations. It is an uncharitable and raſh act in any man, directly to charge his Neighbour with denying him his due, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his goods from him, when he can prove nothing againſt him: and much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59605:33"/> more injuſt it is and impious, for a man to ſay directly, that God denies him grace, or doth harden his heart, ſo that Rules, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſufficient reaſons of becoming faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, righteous, and holy before God and man, are of no effect upon him.</p>

BUT the uſe or act of the grace of Faith reſteth not here, but is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully aſſiſtant to the naturall underſtanding in diſcerning the minde of God revealed unto us in his Word. For as the diſcreet and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Maſter doth not only ſet his Schollar, whom he teacheth to write, an exact and fair Copie to imitate and follow, but alſo guides his hand in the making the Letters and joyning them together, according to their true ſhape and order; in like manner doth he, whoſe Chair is in heaven, teaching the hearts, as his Inſtruments and Officers doe the eares and eyes of men below, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, receive, believe and act according to the Rule and ſcope preſcribed. For man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is apt to believe thoſe things only which his Reaſon aſſures him of, but his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (how acute ſoever) cannot demonſtrate the Scriptures to be the Word of God, which we believe and muſt believe to be ſo, if we would be accounted good Chriſtians: And having the Scriptures in that eſteem, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59605:35"/> out of our promptitude and acuteneſſe of wit, diſcerne clearly and readily many uſefull things therein contained, without the direction of that great Authour, the Bleſſed Spirit, principall in the compoſing them. For 'tis truly ſaid, The Scriptures muſt be underſtood by the Spirit that indited them. According therefore to the gifts and grace given unto Mee, doe they underſtand the myſteries of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. And to every man is given grace according to the meaſure of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 7. whereby that light revealed ſhineth unto the true Believer, as out of a dark place. So that Chriſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his wonted method to reveal ſuch things to the ignorant and Babes, which is commonly denied to the wiſe, noble and Great ones in the world: untill ſuch time as the ſimple and unlearned ſhall proceed ſo far as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get whence themſelves derive that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have; for then ſuddainly it degenerates into folly: and men priding themſelves, and tranſgreſſing the limits of modeſty, humility, and ſubjection, to which they are called, become inſolent, and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious towards them that are over them in the Lord. For ſcarce can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that God, like the fooliſh workman, ſhould pull down with one hand, what he buildeth with another: or, as the wiſe Man ſaith, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 15. 20. <hi>give any man licence

Revelations may be, and are given unto men, but not to ſuch as are the worſe for them; nor to them through whom the Church of God fares the worſe. But moſt probably ſuch egregious abilities are given by the ſubtil and Evill Spirit, who, if men that are evill may give Good gifts unto their Children as Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 11. may alſo doe the ſame to his Children: Children of pride of minde, and diſobedience of life, being of the ſame nature and complexion with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>S. Paul</hi> therefore ſayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The Spirit</hi> (that is, the truly divine) <hi>is given to every man to profit withall.</hi> And this profit is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the profiting of the whole bodie of the Church of Chriſt; the advancing of that, and the thriving in Faith and Charity. So that whatever knowledge (as ſingular and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59605:36"/> admirable as it may ſeem to ſhort-ſighted Chriſtians, who cannot ſee afar off) may be pretended prejudiciall to the Body of Chriſt largely taken, and to the glory of God in generall, but ſwelling the mindes of ſome particular perſons, is far from an edifying faith, or knowledge, whatever ſpecious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may be offer'd to the world thereby, cauſing admiration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But notwithſtanding ſuch frequent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, ſcandalous to the prudent, as inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the ſimple, ſuch a Faith there is, and ſuch an inward Light many times is given and added by God unto the naturall perſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of man, that the effect is wonderfull upon the minde and life of the ſimple, above the Learned. For the naturall man believes becauſe he knows; but the truely ſpirituall knowes becauſe he believes: and his belief is directed by a ſuperiour power; agreeably to that ſaying of the Auncient, ſuppoſed to be in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe ye believe ye ſhall not underſtand.</hi> For ſeeing a prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptitude and preparedneſſe in the minde to receive all impreſſes from him without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputings, or ſuſpicions of errour, he will not ſuffer ſuch honeſt and devout ſimplicitie to want his influence diſpoſing thereunto: ſo that there ſhould be no room or ground left for the faith of God to ſtand on the wiſdome of men, and ſubtile ratiocinations of ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59605:36"/> heads. For many are the Myſteries of faith, not intelligible, and yet Credible divinely: which may be compared to well compoſed and well performed Muſick; which, as the common obſervation teacheth us, is moſt ſweet and pleaſing in the next room; or at a competent diſtance: and yet we ſee few can content themſelves ſo, but muſt needs be preſſing, contrary to their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, into the companie of them who make it, and be viewing curiouſly, and perhaps touching the Inſtruments which yield it, though they have no skill in them. But the honeſt and faithfull ſpirit perſwaded of the neceſſity of things to be believed, and conſcious of its own infirmitie in making out the intrigues of Religion, acquieſces with Humility and Charitie in the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded without endleſſe diſcuſſions, which render them leſſe credible many times, and bring leſſe ſatisfaction than before. For the more a man argues, the more he may.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I have not a little wonder'd at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and compariſon apt enough to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the vertue of an eaſie Faith, and the unhappineſſe of curious enquirers into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion without faith. It was of one who had the leaſt meaſure of Chriſtian faith of any of his age, as his works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, intending to give a new ſcheme or modell of Philoſophie and Religion both:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59605:37"/> infinitely ambitious of applauſe and diſciples: to whom he promiſed great notions, and them more rationall than former Ages, or any Country but <hi>England,</hi> had been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with; but with ſo foul failleur in his firſt principles which he begged, and would with no patience ſuffer to be queſtioned, as ſcarce any unlucky Sophiſter was ſubject to. And ſurely ſuſpecting that what he taught might be as courſely handled as he doth Scripture, and the very Creeds of the Church, i. e. with monſtrous boldneſſe, he would divert men from ſuch attempts by ſuch a fine ſimilitude as is very ſerviceable in other Caſes: As it is with him that is to take phyſicall Pills, for the health of his body, if he takes them into his mouth, and conſidering of them will needs chew them before he ſwallowes them, he will rather ſpit them out of his mouth, as vehemently diſagreeing to his palate, than uſe them to his health: In like manner he who having delivered to him, by good and skilfull inſtructers, the wholeſome principles of ſpirituall life and ſalvation, ſhall, as it were, grinde and chew them by his natural Reaſon to prove what manner of things they are, before he will receive them by Faith, will perhaps never take them down, but caſt them out again, and with them more than them; the greateſt part of all Religion, which before he diſliked not. If this compariſon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59605:37"/> ever fitted any man, it did the Authour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But Reaſon, as the Renowned <hi>Romane</hi> Lawyer of old told us, The greateſt in the world, is that which makes for Religion; and if men would but reflect upon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubting Wit, and whither it at length hurries them, they would never truſt it ſo far, nor give it ſo much rope and ſuch looſe reins as they doe. For, as is ſaid, there being nothing more agreeable to Reaſon, than to acknowledge a Deitie; it more ſtrongly followes, he ſhould be worſhipped: And if a man ſhould be free to take his choice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the great variety offering it ſelfe to a man, methinks out of naturall reaſon, he ſhould preferre the Chriſtian Religion with all its circumſtances and difficulties, before any other in like manner conſidered and examined. And ſo I ſhould think, if by education ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only common reaſon to guide him, he were indifferent, he ſhould chooſe that which was revealed of God, and as revealed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt imbibed that fundamentall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Revelation made alreadie by God, how he would be worſhipped, contained in the Scriptures; and thoſe as infallible Lawes, but lyable to fallible Interpreters and Judges: witneſſe the palpable errours they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with who cry down all men for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, themſelves tacitely excepted. By which ſad experience appeareth the neceſſity of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59605:38"/> conſulting God the Authour of his own Lawes, confidence in his Goodneſſe and Grace, and an obſequious minde to be lead farther, and otherwiſe by him, than naturall reaſon can, or would manage us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This credulouſneſſe was it which Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, and eſpecially the Martyrs excelled in, and whereby they became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, and even invulnerable in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: and whatever the contemporary hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then objected againſt it; and reproached them with as Barbarous, their own Religion (as mean as it was) could never be carried on or ſubſiſt long without: as might be ſhewed by inſtances. Nay, the Chriſtian Fathers of the Church retorted that reviling upon themſelves, in naturall affairs and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; as amongſt many others, <hi>Arnobius</hi> did in this manner. Tell me, doe ye plow the ground, and fill it with varietie of Seeds, not believing that ye ſhall reap the fruits of your labours with increaſe, at the returne of the Seaſon? Doe not you joyn your ſelves in Matrimonie, believing your Conſorts will be chaſt and faithfull to their Covenants? Do you not endeavour procreation, hoping your Children will live, be toward and obedient? Doe ye not merchandize and ſail into far Countries, hoping ye ſhall eſcape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Sea and Land, incident to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailers, and returne with ſafetie and bootie to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59605:38"/> your own Country and Dwelling again? And doe ye not commit your bodies to the care of the Phyſician, when ye are ſick, believing that he can, and will relieve your Dolours? And ye war alſo againſt your Enemies, preſuming ye ſhall win the day. And doe ye not worſhip your Gods believing that they hear you and will anſwer you? Yea, and every School of Philoſophie hath ſuch as very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily believe the Maſter of the Sect, without much arguing or contending. And why then ſhould men ſo boggle at Chriſt and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and ſo hardly digeſt them, becauſe they can pick out many difficulties in it, for which they can give, or perhaps under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no ſufficient reaſon, nor find eaſie reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But it was well replyed to this laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle of Faith in naturall Rationaliſts by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preaching to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> Acts 17. 29. <hi>For as much then as we are the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or ſilver, and ſtone graven by art and mans device.</hi> Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ought we to think that God is like unto man or any thing made by God: ſo as to bring down the notions of a Deity, and the manner of that he chooſes to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by, to agree with mans imagination. To whom will ye compare God, or what likeneſſe will ye compare to him, ſaith the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59605:39"/> Prophet <hi>Iſaiah?</hi> intimating unto us, that as God in matter and forme agreeth not with any created being, ſo neither in his will, acts, or outward operations is he to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by any created Rule, or judged. But he is only Rule to himſelfe, and us too, of believing and doing; and none underſtanding God cleerly and fully but himſelfe; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which we have of him and his Will muſt be derived from himſelfe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that expreſſion of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 5. <hi>They looked unto him and were ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and their faces were not aſhamed.</hi> For as it is in the ſame Book of Pſalmes, <hi>In thy light we ſhall ſee light. Moſes</hi> was thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened in his face even to coruſcation, when he beheld Gods face; and that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed luſtre communicated it ſelfe unto ſtanders by, and beholders. So likewiſe God having diſcovered himſelfe by his holy Word, by the eye of Faith ſtedfaſtly behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him we are illuminated alſo, more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fully and ſublimely than by all the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious lectures of the wiſe ones of this world, wanting ſuch aſſiſtances: as he that puts on Spectacles ſhall (if defective in his ſight) ſee more, and better, than any of the ſame imperfection, who ſhall ſpend his whole life in reading over the learned Treatiſes of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or Art of Seeing. An experience of more than one or two, I could inſtance in,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59605:39"/> I-ſuppoſe may teach us, that when the Soule is truely devoted to Religion, which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſurmiſes and ſuggeſtions would weaken and moleſt, they have heartily wiſhed they had known leſſe, and believed more; or that God would ſtrengthen their faith, or weaken their reaſon; there being a kinde of naturall petulancie in unſanctified reaſon, upon all turnes, to give moleſtation to Faith, till it be ſilenced with ſtrong reſolutions of firmly adhering to our Chriſtian Principles.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. A man would think that much read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and much learning, and profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not only of humane ſtamp and order, but Divine, conſiſting in the knowledge of the Scriptures and the myſteries of the Kingdome of Heaven, and the ſnares of the world, and the deceivableneſſe of ſin, and the infirmities of fleſh and blood, and the ſeverall ſtratagems of the Devill, might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a man from the ſeverall temptations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to our ſpirituall warfare. But all theſe be the Gifts and bleſſings of God, and very uſefull to others as well as a mans ſelfe, and ſo very deſireable; yet very often it ſo falls out, that they leaſt of all ſuffice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the aſſailants ſpirituall the owner meets with in this world, but are profitable and ſerviceable to others inferiour to him. So that what we read, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 1. 18. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes verified, <hi>He that encreaſeth knowledge
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59605:40"/> encreaſeth ſorrow:</hi> For as Great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rourrs and Conquerours in this world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Enemies as they enlarge their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: ſo that whileſt they content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with narrower Territories, they have fewer Adverſaries, than when they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their ſphere to more, and remoter Countries: for then the orb without them, and ſurrounding them, is alſo much more large, and affordes more evill Neighbours readie at all times to infeſt them; ſo as a man dilates his knowledge, he ſhall ſtart more difficulties warring againſt his faith, than thoſe plain and honeſt Believers who in compariſon of them, know very little. And as hard, if not harder a matter it is for men of great knowledge, to encounter all thoſe objections which diſcover themſelves to the learned, as it is for the more ignorant to withſtand temptations occurring to him, fewer and weaker.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And in truth, neither the one nor the other ſuffices of himſelfe to caſt down imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. 5.) and every high thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt the knowledge of God, ſo as to bring into captivitie every thought to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt. But God hath ordained cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpeciall Intellectuall gifts, whereby man is aſſiſted in his courſe and conflict in this world: which are uſually termed the ſeven
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59605:40"/> Intellectuall Gifts, illuſtrious in Chriſt in the firſt place, and derived unto his faithfull members from him the head; mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 11. ſuch as Quick underſtanding, Wiſdome, Counſell, Might or Fortitude, Knowledge, and the fear of the Lord: and if there be any others diſtinct from theſe, (into which quarrell I will not now enter) ſurely they are the ſpeciall gifts of God, given unto man for his inſtruction, direction, guidance and aſſiſtance in the affairs of his ſoule.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VII. Of Illumination reflexive, whereby a Chriſtian ſoule comes to the knowledge of its ſelfe, in its Spirituall ſtate.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BY the Book of Nature a man attains to many rare and uſefull things, and eſpecially of God; and by common reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in holy Scriptures may the myſteries of God and Godlineſſe be made known unto him: all which may be ſaid to be neceſſary and uſefull; but ſcarce otherwiſe than as they lead him to the knowledge of himſelfe and the ſtate of his ſoule towards God; to which a twofold Revelation is required. The firſt common to all Chriſtians, declaring
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59605:41"/> the Doctrine of Faith and rules of holy Life, principles of well believing and doing. But the ſecond we are taught to be more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary than the firſt; that is, ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or rather ſenſe of a mans particular and inward man, which tends to a cenſuring and condemning himſelfe, or a peaceable and comfortable perſwaſion of ſuch a ſtate of Grace and Gods favour as ends in immortall Bliſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and loſe his own ſoule?</hi> So may we ſay, What will it profit a Chriſtian, to know the whole world and to be ignorant of his own ſoule? For to know the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their nature and number, and various motions, is no heavenly knowledge. And to know God himſelfe by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſpeculations, is no Godly knowledge of it ſelfe; but the knowledge of a mans ſelfe in the particular relations he hath to God, and Chriſt the Son of God, and Saviour of the world, and of himſelfe eſpecially. For this knowledge, God ſeems to reſerve to himſelfe, to be communicated at his pleaſure. For as Chriſt himſelfe teaches us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>No man knoweth the Son but the Father, and no man knoweth the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom ſoever the Son will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale him;</hi> it may no leſſe truly be ſaid,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59605:41"/> No man knoweth himſelfe in his Religious or Spirituall capacities, but he to whom God hath revealed himſelfe. For this kinde of knowledge a man is as averſe to, as he is prone to naturall knowledge by induſtrious ſpeculation. For who deſires to finde an hole, or ſpot in his own Coat? Yea, who can patiently be told of any blemiſh in his Face, that his Noſe is too bigge, and that his Eyes are too little, or that his Face is pimpled and high colour'd, or that his Mouth is too wide, or that one Leg is ſhorter than another, or ſuch like imperfections of nature or deformities? And the minde and ſoule being more neer unto us, and valued by us than our viſible parts, much more troubled are we, when any defect is in them noted. For as it is obſerved that Nature hath made all men handſome enough in their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as to their outward perſon; ſo hath it made all men wiſe enough, vertuous enough, and holy enough: And though a current principle of Religion teaches many men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and upon ſome occaſions, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to acknowledge their weakneſſes and imperfections, yet if another affirms the like things of them, they are much moleſted and offended, conceiving ſome ill will, or ſpite to be the cauſe of ſuch cenſures. And men doe naturally but jeſt with themſelves to others, when they undervalue themſelves, in hopes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59605:42"/> and expectation that ſuch as hear them will take an occaſion from thence to refute them by the return of praiſes and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their worth, for that very thing in which they diſparaged themſelves, more than recompenſing ſuch defects.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Religion then, and that not in Books but written in the tables of the Heart, and affecting rather than adviſing, can alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently imprint in a man the knowledge of himſelfe towards God: to which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a good preparation is made by Gods Word, untill the Grace of God and Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation truly ſupernaturall ſhall open more fully the eyes of the underſtanding, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, to a more perfect ſenſe of a mans ſelfe, by the conſideration of theſe Five things, What we were not: What we were: What we are: What we ought to be: and What we certainly ſhall be hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By what we were not, I mean, that once we were not at all: which Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation hath only infallibly taught us and determined, above the Philoſophie of ſome, and againſt the Philoſophie of others: And once it was, that not ſo much as in the loyns of Nature man was to be found; as all we at preſent may be ſaid to have been in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> before we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the world. For <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe was no where amongſt naturall cauſes to be found,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59605:42"/> in the moſt ſlender being of all, untill God had produced him abſolutely: nothing of it ſelfe producing only nothing; and being worſe than that vile lump of earth out of which man was ſhaped; all theſe things concurring to humble man upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of his baſe extraction by his Mothers ſide, and being no better by his Fathers ſide, God Creatour of all things, than other ugly and odious creatures in his eye; but much the worſe, as the maſſe of humane fleſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leaven'd with the vain cogitations of the minde, and inordinate concupiſcences and affectations, corrupted himſelfe above other creatures, and by that contagion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting him. With what great bluſhing and confuſion then ſhould we reflect upon our fruſtrating Gods deſigne and order, which being to be exemplarie in vertue and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, unto other inferiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, have render'd them more vile and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly. And which is more lamentable, as it is moſt ſhamefull, in the ſtate degencrate into which man is fallen by his free frailty, for man to be more puffed up, and fanſie to himſelfe an Empire, even while he is tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized over by the rebells of his own breſt, this is that which requires his ſevereſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and judicature of him; and not, as the common manner is, with modeſter Chriſtians, to ſhuffle up accounts between
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59605:43"/> God and the ſoule, (others taking little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of one way or other, their paſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or preſent imperfections) and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe we are all to blame, we have all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and are fallen ſhort of the glorie of God, and that we generally carrie about us a bodie full of ſpirituall infirmities, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to failings and falls. But theſe things touch us not more particularly; or, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the confuſed maſſe of ſin acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dwell in us, we have ſome proper and ſpeciall paſſions, or addictions to ſin, this we either cannot diſcerne in our ſelves, or through ſelfe-conceitedneſſe naturall to all men, we will not underſtand, untill a Light from heaven (as it happened to St. <hi>Paul</hi>) though not in that outward and miraculous manner, but by a certain tacite ſplendour and illumination, all the receſſes and dark corners of the ſoule are diſcovered, and the foulneſſe of them manifeſted in particular.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For as it happens to the poor Cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or ſimple careleſſe Tenant; while the Houſwife is alone with her own plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie only, ſhe ſees little or nothing amiſſe in her Houſe, it is clean enough, as it ſeems to her ſelfe; and all things are ſet in order, and place convenient enough to her liking; but it chancing that ſhe is ſurpriſed by ſome Great and delicate Perſon coming into her habitation, or that her rich and fine Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59605:43"/> comes into her Houſe, then preſently ſhe lookes about her every way, then ſhe ſees nothing is clean enough, handſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or in place and order good enough; but complains how ſhe is taken like a Slut: So falls it out in Divine matters, and with the careleſſe and ſecure ſoule, while ſhe looks only on her ſelfe, and compares her ſelfe with her ſelfe, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with other of the ſame rank with her ſelfe, ſhe diſcerns very little amiſſe within her ſelfe; but Chriſt our Lord, and the Holy Spirit the light of the minde and ſearcher of the heart coming into it; then ſhe begins to apprehend her own uncleanlineſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; then is ſhe ſenſible of her diſorders, foulneſſe, and even Sluts corners; and begins to lament her ſtate, and confeſſe her errours, and beg pardon for her unfitneſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutableneſſe to the Divine preſence; A live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance whereof, holy <hi>Job</hi> may be in the Old Teſtament: and <hi>Peter</hi> in the New; both eminent Saints. <hi>Job</hi> had diſcourſed freely and confidently of God and his wayes, and juſtified himſelfe to a high degree before him. He aſſerted his own innocencie and cleanneſſe before him, and men: Yea, God himſelfe vindicated him from the calumnies of Satan, ſaying, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Haſt thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

                  <p n="5">5. And thus particularly informed and affected, the ſoule not only judges ſin in others to be ſin, but in it ſelfe exceeding ſinfull: not only believes that Anger, and Malice, and cenſuring, and ſlandering others, that unclean acts, that light, wanton, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall thoughts are evill in others, but in it ſelfe; that immodeſt words and geſtures, unkinde, ſowr, froward behaviour and looks doe ill become others profeſſing the Goſpell, which ſweetens ſowr blood and carriage naturally, ſo far as may conſiſt with ſobriety and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, but in its ſelfe too; and diſpoſes to a change of temper, knowing what St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59605:44"/> ſaith, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>That the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſufferance, gentleneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance:</hi> And that the Rule of Juſtice given by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould doe unto you, doe yee even ſo unto them,</hi> extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the regulating of outward looks and behaviour, which ſhould be no other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others (diſtance of Relations being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as becometh) than we expect from others towards us. And ſo in all other vices fleſh and blood is ſubject to, even leſſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, the good man firſt condemns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being more quick-ſighted in perceiving, and ſevere in cenſuring himſelfe than others.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And upon, and together with the ſight and ſenſe of a mans imperfections and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, doth the Day-ſtar ariſing in the heart direct to the exerciſe of the contrary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues both Morall and Evangelicall; and ſuch a transformation by the renewing of the minde, whereby, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, we may prove what is the will of God: and that the will of God is our Sanctification, as it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 4. 3. And that Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication conſiſteth in a conformity to the Image of his Son: wherein the illuminated minde may perceive all the lines or Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new man, and the forme of true Godlineſſe. So that as he that copieth out an exquiſite Picture, or he that draweth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59605:45"/> to the life muſt have a clear eye, and that eye muſt be conſtantly fixed on the Patern before it, which is to be followed; in like manner, in the ſpirituall Faſhioning of the Soul to the Grand Example Chriſt, a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and ſtrict eye muſt be had and fixed on him; whereby it will appear, what of the naturall ſtone is to be knocked or pared off by mortification, what is to be done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conformableneſſe to the Image of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And to this alſo conduceth much what is mentioned farther concerning our future ſtate of happineſſe or miſery hereafter, and the vanity and fallacies of preſent enjoyments and poſſeſſions, which latter ſeem to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlightened eye, great and corpulent, being in truth but ſhadowes; as the former, to the eye of the underſtanding opened, ſolid and weighty, and to be conſidered above all things. For we dye but once naturally, and are not like the hearb, or flower, or plant which flouriſheth in its ſeaſon, and in his ſeaſon fades and dies, with an aptneſſe to return again to its former perfection, even to many ſuch viciſſitudes: the tall Cedar, or fine Flower, in his own eſtimation, Man, neceſſarily and naturally tending to decay and ruine, Dies once and where is he? ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 14. and by no ſent of waters buddeth again, or riſeth from his cold bed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59605:45"/> of earth, till the heavens be no more: and ariſeth by an Allmighty power, but no more to return to his place and condition, to amend what he before had done amiſſe, or ſo much as to repent fruitfully of what he formerly offended in. How then doth it concern every true Believer to be ſerious with himſelfe, and ſtanding aſſured there is no Sabbath of pleaſure here, ſuddenly all our vaine imaginations of ſenſible delights here, are ſurpriſed by the ſhadowes of our approaching death, overtaking, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing them: and that being come, there is no redemption of our miſpent dayes, no recovery of our voluntarie loſſes of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of temperance, ſobrietie, chaſtity, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, meekneſſe, charity, good works, and devotion towards God. Can any that hath his ſenſes (I ſay not, that wit which ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate worldlings too often, but vainly vaunt of) run ſuch a notorious hazard as this, in purſuit (as Children of Butter flies) of the emptie and periſhing vanities, and foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (even in this life) their Fingers in catching theſe worldly pleaſures.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And why ſhould I adde the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſuch evill infatuations, and choice, as is made here by ſuch whom the God of this world hath blinded? Doth not even Nature teach us, that there is a reward of Good and Evill? And doe not our ſenſes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59605:46"/> or common obſervation teach us, that that reward is not preciſely or conſtantly diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this life, but very often all things (as it is in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi>) befall all men alike; him that ſacrifices, and him that ſacrifices not: which the Divine Wiſdome hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that men might erect their mindes and direct their hearts to the ſtate after Death, and ſtead faſtly believe and accurate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration both of good and evill; and that ſevenfold, to what men ſuffer or enjoy of all the labour or pleaſure taken in this life, in purſuit of Good and Evill. This our Chriſtian Creeds would have us perfectly ſetled in: This the Holy Scripture often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates unto true Believers: And the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 7. 36. <hi>Whatſoever thou takeſt in hand, remember thy latter end and thou ſhalt never doe amiſſe:</hi> Know thy ſelfe and preſent frailties, infirmities, and vain inclinations expoſing thee to ſin and errours. Remember the great end thou wert placed for in this world; Remember the inevitable ſtroke of Death deſtroying this Body, and the inevitable Reſurrection reſtoring it again to never-dying joy or miſerie. Know and believe theſe things, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually, and thy ſelfe thorowly, by a ſpirituall Philoſophie making thee wiſe to vertue and godlineſſe here, and to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereafter.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59605:46"/>
                  <p>To the attaining this Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans ſelfe, ſome of the wiſer and ſoberer Philoſophers, and much more, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and holy Fathers of the Church, doe often exhort others and exerciſe themſelves, at the concluſion of the Day, revolving in their mindes, what they had done, and what they had not, the day paſſed: and all this diſcerning themſelves, and judging their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons impartially, they might adjuſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts between God and their own ſouls; and as the Tradeſman deſirous to thrive, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten turns over his Day book (as he calls it) and his Debt-book, the better to underſtand whether he thrives or runs behind-hand in the world, ſo every prudent and thrifty ſoule frequently reflects on its ſelfe and actions; what he hath laid out, and what he hath taken in to its advantage, or prejudice. If the good Emperour bewailed his hard hap when he upon reflexion upon what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one day, ſaid, <hi>My Friends we have loſt a day:</hi> how much more reaſon of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may inconſiderate and diſſolute Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ruminating upon ill-ſpent time, ſay, My Friends we have loſt Eternitie, we have loſt our Souls, or at leaſt forfeited them ſo far as may not be regained without true and timely repentance, and renovation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which can be obtained without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſelves; nor that, without ſearch

                  <head>SECT. VIII. Of Revelations or Illuminations extraordinarie by Spirits: and the diſcerning of them: with the uſe of ſuch Revelations.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BUT hitherto have we treated of ſuch Light and Knowledge, which God, in the ordinary courſe of his Covenant with Man, generally vouchſafes unto him: Now we proceed briefly to conſider the Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of Illuminations; and (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. 1.) come to Viſions and Revelations in the Lord. For that ſuch there have been, and ſuch there may be, who ever believes the Holy Scriptures, muſt not deny; and whoever will allow any credit to Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories and Traditions, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denie. I know God hath given us a ſufficient Rule revealed in his Word, and ſo ſufficient that we ought not importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeek for ſuch extraordinarie manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of himſelfe; yet hath he not ſo far
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59605:47"/> tyed his own hands, as he hath our luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant appetites after knowledge, which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported our firſt Parents, and darkened, and degraded them; but having diſtributed to every man according to the meaſure of his Faith, he, of his undeſerved, and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberality, caſts into our dimenſion, the overplus of immediate Illuminations. The gift of Propheſie before Chriſt; and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent grant of Viſions to the beloved and honoured Patriarchs before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> manifeſtly prove this beyond doubt or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Of which reaſons are endeavoured to be render'd by the ſubtile and learned, not belonging to this place. But as for Prophets and Seers, after the Law given, they were not only the Life and vigour of the Law ſo delivered, which otherwiſe might, and too often did lie languiſhing and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; but ſo many ſpeciall intimations of the minde of God to his people, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Law likewiſe to their Poſterities. And we, <hi>upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. are entred into their labours and Lights of Revelations; and that with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and acceſſions of more cleer and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Revelations than the world before had been acquainted with. And with this Bodie of Divinity or Divine Revelations, we may ſafely, and ought thankfully and modeſtly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59605:48"/> to acquieſce: not deſpiſing Prophecyings, as the Apoſtle adviſes, conſonant to that known Rule given us. And that theſe materiall Revelations (as I may ſo call them) are not ſo full and manifeſt, as to make all Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations ſuperfluous and fruitleſſe, even the preciſeſt admirers of Scriptures will grant; themſelves laying ſpeciall claim to acceſſorie Revelations or Inſpirations. And an eminent inſtance to this purpoſe is given in the two Diſciples travailing to <hi>Emaus, Luke</hi> 24. who underſtood the Scriptures, we may ſuppoſe, as well as others, generally; and to help them therein, had acted before their eyes, what was before propheſied of Chriſt, and yet could they not underſtand nor believe the Scriptures, untill Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto them all the Propheſies from <hi>Moſes</hi> and downward, concerning himſelfe. And upon the ſame occaſion of the other Diſciple not believing, Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 45. is ſaid <hi>to open their underſtanding that they might underſtand the Scriptures:</hi> which gift of God (as hath been touched before) will never ceaſe to be uſefull to the ſame ends. For the office and gift of the Spirit ſhall never ceaſe, untill the Saints and Servants of God come to contemplation of God face to face: and Chriſt hath deliver'd up the Kingdome to the Father.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59605:48"/>
                  <p n="2">2. A great inſtance whereof, though perhaps a little digreſſive, we have in one of the moſt fundamentall Articles of our Faith, queſtioned by that wretch <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers, directed only by their private naturall wits: Upon the words of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpell, Chap 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God,</hi> we believe that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Man, and the ſecond Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie Incarnate. And ſome naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (as the famous <hi>Emilius</hi> the Platoniſt) by common underſtanding diſcerned a Great Myſterie of the Deitie to be intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but that unnaturall Chriſtian <hi>Socinus</hi> could not, or would not apprehend ſo much; the reaſon whereof may be that given by Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>John</hi> 9. 39. <hi>For judgement am I come into the world, that they which ſee not might ſee, and they which ſee might be made blinde.</hi> They who have nothing to helpe themſelves but mere naturall light, may ſooner come to the light of Religion, induſtriouſly and modeſtly uſing that one Talent deliver'd to them: but they who ſtand upon termes with God, and refuſe all other information beſides naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhall fall by the folly of their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous knowledge. This is the ordinary fate of ſuch perſons puffed up with their fleſhly minde.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59605:49"/>
                  <p n="3">3. So on the other extreme, divers Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians having heard and read of extraordinarie Revelatious imparted by God; and looking upon the Light without, the Scriptures, as a dark and dead letter, in compariſon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie and Inward Light, ambitiouſly aſpire to that, and credulouſly flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not without oſtentations outwardly, that they are priviledged thereby, to their ruine: anſwerably to the exceſſive curioſity of the Greateſt of the Heathen Philoſophers, who having paſſed the bounds of vulgar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, were pricked forward with immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſtudie of ſuch ſecrets of Nature, which they found they could not attain to but by commerce with Spirits; and therefore, with many vain and vile rites were tempted to combine with them in ſuch purſuits of knowledge. So that it is obſerved by Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, very few there were of them, who had not his <hi>familiar</hi> to aſſiſt him. And I have often and much wonder'd with my ſelfe, whence it ſhould proceed, that evill and naturall men ſhould ſo eaſily and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obtain the converſation and aſſiſtance of evill Spirits; and good and ſpirituall men, ſo rarely obtain without deluſions, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operations of Good Spirits, or Angells for their more perfect Illumination and directions. Yet at length, I ſatisfied my ſelfe with ſuch an account as this; not knowing how it may ſatisfie others.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59605:49"/>
                  <p n="4">4. The ground of all Divine Preſence I take to be Puritie of heart and affection, which is ſo rarely and hardly attained unto, as to make the ſoule ſuſceptible of ſuch an Harbinger: and therefore no wonder that Gods Spirit ſhould eſtrange it ſelfe from ſuch as are not purged according to the rate at leaſt of humane frailty, from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of fleſh and ſpirit: But wicked ſpirits ſtand not ſo much upon ſuch prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and prediſpoſitions as thoſe; though, to conceale from men what their reaſon would teach them to lothe them for, there conſtantly were uſed certain Ceremonies pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, (as they ſuppoſed,) diſpoſing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended purity: as Poets have taught us. And even in the Apothegmes of the Fathers in <hi>Olympius</hi> a devout Hermite; we read of a certain Heathen Prieſt, who entring into the Cell of a Chriſtian Monk, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in great auſterity and Devotion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether God did not in extraordinary manner reveal Myſteries to him; who anſwered, No. 'Tis ſtrange, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, that ſo it ſhould not be with you taking ſuch pains: whereas we ſeeking our God ſo, finde anſwers and ſee myſteries: therefore ſure it muſt needs be (ſaid he) that your hearts are not clean before him: which the Chriſtians wondering to hear from him, confeſſed it to be ſo indeed. But did
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59605:50"/> that Heathen Prieſt perſwade himſelfe, that their hearts were cleaner than the Chriſtians? It may be ſo: but the truer reaſon was, that their god, (ſo free of his Oracles and Revelations) was not ſo clean himſelfe as the Holy Spirit by whom Revelations are given unto men; and therefore might be more forward to afford an impure heart his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure companie. Their cleanneſſe conſiſted in carnall abſtinences; ſuch as they write that great Magician <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi> to have excelled in, and to have had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Spirits. But purity of minde and unroyled and undiſturbed Paſſions are that wherein ſuch Chriſtian purity doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, which diſpoſeth to, or at leaſt goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Inſpirations truly Divine, and ſpirituall Illuminations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another reaſon why evill Spirits are ſo officious to attend their Confederates; and the Holy Spirit not ſo ſignally preſent with Holy Men, may be, the purity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention required to the Spirit of God, more than to deluding Spirits. For no more or greater impediment needs there be to the entrance of the miraculous Spirit of God, than a paſſionate thirſt after Revelations and Viſions, which imply a miſlead underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not rightly judging wherein conſiſts true Divineneſſe; but ſuppoſing that Gifts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from unmortified curioſitie, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59605:50"/> tending to vain glorie and elevation of a mans, minde above others, render a man ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, which God, <hi>who ſcattereth the proud in the imagination of his heart, and exalteth them of low degree,</hi> Luke 2. 51, 52. moſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth, and will not be acceſſarie to: but rather delivers him over to Spirits anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his appetite and humour, which ſhall deceive and abuſe him. A famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof we have in this Nation in the laſt age, of a man very Mathematically learned, and not wanting in other Sciences: very retired in his Life, and exemplarie in his converſation, with Devotion extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie towards God: but being ardently ſet on Revelations, and ſeeking Oracles from Spirits, obtained his end ſo far as to have Spectres preſented to him, through Glaſſes, and certain anſwers humouring exactly his ſuperſtition and curioſitie; ſo that he could not conſider, that it is without precedent Divine and of God, that female Spirits ſhould appear as ſent from him; and that ſuch theatricall geſtures and ſpeeches could not conſiſt with the Majeſtie of God, or the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of his Angells ſent by him: ſo that the large Volume of ſuch like Impoſtures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to this day as a monument of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuations, and a Rock to ſuch as ſhall ſail by ſuch Compaſſes. It is above an hundred years ſince this Deluſion diſturbed <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59605:51"/> and other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> too, eſpecially <hi>Germanie.</hi> But not many yeers are paſſed ſince a more prodigious one of this kinde was afforded us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by a phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Major, allmoſt Sainted by the vulgar Innovatours in Religion, for his well-mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hypocriſie and ſtupendious gifts of Prayer extemporie; ſo that no leſſe than <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he of a long time had bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that unhappie people to an obduration in an inveterate Schiſme, and admiration of his Illuminations; untill his iniquitie was found to be hatefull, as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36. and ſuch a diſcovery of his beſtialities and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practices, as are not to be uttered by chaſt mouths, or heard by chaſt ears.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Theſe and ſuch like ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſpirituall Illuminations ending in ſuch ſcandalous events, have put wiſe and grave Heads upon the Doctrine of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of Spirits, as they informe or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe men: having ſo juſt warrant as ſuch ſad experiments miniſter'd, and the precept of Saint <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Beloved, believe not every Spirit; but try the ſpirits whether they be of God, becauſe many falſe ſpirits are gone out into the world.</hi> And to this end I hold it uſefull to diſtinguiſh three kindes of Illuminations: the firſt mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Speculative, repreſenting unto the minde fine and rare objects, and heavenly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59605:51"/> Scenes of God himſelfe, and Chriſt, and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Quires of Saints, and ſuch like; not at all tending to edification of him that hath them, or of any others. This ſort I ſhould think to be generally vain and illuſive; as tending to nothing ſo much as the ſwelling of a mans minde up with conceit of his being a favourite of Heaven. This that prudent holy Man ſaw, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ancient Hiſtories: When the Devill appearing to him with a glorious retinue, repreſenting Chriſt, and the good Angells attending him; Saint <hi>Itor</hi> (for ſo was his name) demanded what all that meant? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was made, by that Lyar <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that he was Chriſt, whom he had ſo faithfully ſerved, and was come to refreſh and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him with the manifeſtation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in that reſplendent manner. Chriſt come to me, ſaid he? I deſire not to ſee Chriſt on earth, but in Heaven: and him I there daily worſhip and enjoy; whereupon the Devills Stratageme not ſucceeding, he with his Complices is ſaid ſuddenly, and with ſhame, to have vaniſhed. The like doth <hi>Gerſon</hi> (Of the Tryall of Spirits) relate of another Holy Man, to whom none other, but the Devill appeared in the forme of Chriſt, telling him, that he was Chriſt: but he believing him not, clapt both his hands before his eyes, and ſaid, <hi>I will not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59605:52"/> ſee Chriſt here upon earth! it ſuffices me that I ſhall one day ſee him in Heaven.</hi> And <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> in the Life of Saint <hi>Martin</hi> tells us, that upon a time, an Apparition very ſplendid being made to him, reſembling Chriſt; he flatly denied to behold it, ſaying, <hi>I will not ſee Chriſt any otherwiſe than as he appeared on earth, crucified.</hi> From whence may be, it is, that moderne Revelations and Viſions pretended of Chriſt and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> are much framed after this Pattern, yet often alſo otherwiſe, and with the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability and uſe. It ſeems to me therefore a very good argument of an evill Viſion, when ſuch are ſent only to be admired and ſtar'd on. And when a ſtrong deſire in men, not otherwiſe evill, to be partakers of ſtrange ſights and Revelations poſſeſſes them, it is probable enough, that God may puniſh their carnall fondneſſe of that nature, with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them over to ſuch deluſions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ready enough to doe their office of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Secondly, From the matter of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, judgement may be competently made of the Revelation it ſelfe; whence it cometh and what it is. For in our Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards-God, we muſt alwayes build upon ſome ſuch firme and unſhaken foundations given us by Chriſt in his Revealed Word, whereby we are to try all extraordinary
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59605:52"/> Illuminations, or Viſions, or Revelations. So that whatever ſhakes or weakens thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples given us, muſt not be allowed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, but from our vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the ſubtile blandiſhments of the Tempter. To deny Chriſt come in the fleſh, was in Saint <hi>John</hi>'s age a ſigne of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Spirit. To ſubvert the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the ſilencing of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law; To abuſe Chriſtian Libertie, to an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the fleſh. To break the bond of Unitie and Chriſtian Charitie, by diſowning and contemptuouſly diſobeying Governours for every frivolous matter, and ſuch like, was, in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s dayes, lookt on, and taught by him, to be inconſiſtent with a Goſpell Spirit, or ſound Revelations, and ſuch, that though an Angell from Heaven ſhould teach ſuch contrarietie to Chriſtianity, he was to be Anathematized. There muſt be therefore, as judicious Authours tell us, the like forme in all ſound Revelations to us, as was found in Chriſts, at the time of his Transfiguration; there muſt be <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> joyned with them: that is, the Law and the Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God vouching them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. A Second ſort therefore may be ſuch Viſions as are partly Speculative and partly Practicall, having indeed extraordinarie Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, but not reſting there, but tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59605:53"/> to good or evill: by which, their good or evill natures may be diſcerned. For as much as God cannot denie himſelfe, as the Scripture aſſures us: neither may he by Extraordinary intimations warrant us to doe that which ordinarily he forbids: ſo that they, as pretended Prophets, may be known by their works, as Chriſt tells us. For though the Devill may doe good ſometimes, (at leaſt in appearance) yet God never doth evill: neither (as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith) tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth he any man ſo to doe. To Preach therefore againſt Truth; to pray againſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the whole Body of the Church, with a ſeeming advantage to ſome few; to Propheſie without Rule, order, or ſubjection, is to bewray the bitter fountain from which ſuch ſweet waters flow. And though the Devill may ſometimes ſpeak as well as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the truth, God cannot at any time ſpeak what is untrue. When therefore pretended Lights and Viſions fail of their due event and end, it is certain that that Light is from him that transformes himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of Light: but is not ſo in trueth. And this was the Character God himſelfe gave unto his own People the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to preſerve them from Impoſtures and deluſions of falſe Prophets; and by which they were wont to try and judge of Prophets, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 18, 22. <hi>When a Prophet ſpeaketh in the name of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59605:53"/> Lord, If the thing follow not, nor come to paſſe, that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken, but the Prophet hath ſpoken it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly: thou ſhalt not be affraid of him.</hi> But in ſome caſes the ſigne was to be judged by the matter, and not the matter by the ſigne; <hi>viz.</hi> When the extraordinary Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tended to the ſubverſion of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points of Religion, as is ſaid before. For ſo we read, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 13. 1, 2. <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet and a dreamer of Dreams, and giveth thee a ſigne or a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: And the ſigne or the Wonder come to paſſe, whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us goe and ſerve other gods, which thou haſt not known, and let us ſerve them, Thou ſhalt not hearken unto the words of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> &amp;c. So that we may ſee from hence, that Viſions leading to ſuperſtitions, doe not ſo much commend theſe, as theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Again, as it is with Diamonds and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jewells, generally of great value, when they are ſcarce and rare, but being brought in heaps, and common, are either counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, or loſe their wonted worth; ſo is it with Viſions, Raptures, and extraordinarie Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations, where they are common and familiar, they may loſe their eſteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and be reduced to the Claſſis of Diſeaſes, and the ſublimating of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59605:54"/> to ſtrange apprehenſions and ſpeeches incident to bodily inflammations, of which, notable inſtances and many are extant in the reports of Phyſicians, as well as them who treat of Poſſeſſions. And I can think little more reverently of the frequentation of Viſions and Revelations celebrated in the Lives of thoſe three famous Women pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed together, <hi>viz. Hildegardis, Elizabeth, Micthildis:</hi> which afford us ſuch inſtances by buſhells, as it were; I will not inſtance in <hi>Jacobus de Voragine</hi> his <hi>Golden Legend,</hi> nor <hi>Caeſarius Heiberſtachius,</hi> as I could, to the great diſadvantage of that Cauſe which was intended to be advanced thereby; as ſuch, at which the modeſter and graver of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion need not any other to put them upon bluſhing at; they doe it of themſelves. But when I read in the Viſions of <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Sienna</hi> ſainted, a perpetuall ſtorie of God himſelfe appearing to her, and preaching in perſon to her, almoſt through the whole book, (though I like the Sermon very well, and muſt needs acknowledge the Documents deliver'd to be many of them very Divine and uſefull) I cannot aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scene there given us. If theſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, (as we ſay of Phanaticall and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inſpirations and gifts of Prayer in Publick) were ſo Divine as reputed and affirmed, why doe they not become Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall?
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59605:54"/> Why are they not equallized to the Holy Scriptures? But things are not come to that height, thankes be to God, unleſſe with them who glorying immodeſtly of a Light within them, and the Word and Will and Wiſdome of God given into them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the written Word; themſelves, for this very reaſon, becoming ſuſpected, convicted, and deteſtable.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But thoſe Viſions which are ſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall and groſſe as that they end, as in their conſummation, in the gratifying of our ſenſes outward, and them the groſſeſt, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, in my opinion, the ſpiritualneſſe, and even the honeſty of Revelations, and notably ſhake the reputation of that Religion which countenances them. If it were recorded only in an unapproved Author, what I finde in the Sermon of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Preacher, <hi>Granatenſis,</hi> Vol. 5. pag. 387. concerning the ſame <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Sienna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Granatenſ. Vol. 5. Conc. 3. in Cathar. <hi>pag.</hi> 387.</note> it might have been leſſe ſcandalous, to read of the great and frequent familiarity between Chriſt and her, ſo that termes of wooing paſſed between them for a long time, till at length, ſhe was ſenſibly eſpouſed to him: but what were the conſequences of that Wedding, I know not. This, to my apprehenſion, is a true conſequence of ſuch Revelations, that it muſt be the Devill rather than Chriſt that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59605:55"/> ſo appeared, and led away a ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laden with ſinne in the midſt of her profeſſion of Sanctity, or that theſe Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers have ſhamefully belied that repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Saint. And on the other ſide, the like inſtances might be given of ſuch who were ſo vehemently devoted to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as to win her love ſo far, as to condeſcend to ſuffer her breaſts to be handled by her Saints. A little more cleanly and credible is that ſtory in the <hi>Remains</hi> of <hi>Gregorie Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> of an Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Faith which he received from Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, by the meanes of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God. But the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts themſelves are ſo modeſt (we thank them) as not to hold it to be the ſame we now have under that name. And we are ſo bold to tell them, that their Viſions, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Revelations, ſo much ſometimes with the ignorant ſort boaſted of, have done them more diſcredit with the wiſer, than good, or honour.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And to theſe another note of true and falſe Illuminations and Alluminations, (which I may call all outward Diſcoveries made to the ſenſes) may be that made by the obſervation of the Maſters of ſuch Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: That in the true and near approach of God and his Holy Spirit to the ſenſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or minde inward, firſt great trouble,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59605:55"/> ſurpriſement, conſternation, and deep humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation are wrought upon the ſpirit of him the Lord vouchſafes ſo to honour with his preſence, as it appears by <hi>Ezechiell</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Daniell;</hi> and before them, by <hi>Manoah:</hi> who were ſtruck with dread and confuſion at the Revelations made unto them: as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was the Bleſſed Virgin, at the aſpect and Annunciation of the Angell <hi>Gabriell,</hi> but in the winding up and concluſion, they were all refreſhed and comforted aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. On the contrary, the ſpecious Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Inſinuations of Evill Angells are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with great delight of the deluded minde; and in the concluſion, bring ſhame, ſorrow, and confuſion: anſwerable indeed to the method of the tempter in all other Caſes: in which the good Wine is brought forth firſt; of which when men have well drunk, followes the bad: but Chriſt firſt ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his faithfull ſervants, the bad, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the beſt to the laſt of all: that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to doe thee Good at the latter end; as it is ſaid, <hi>Deuteron,</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Brisk, Pert, and vaunting are the gifted by Evill Spirits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon ſuch their perfections above others; but modeſt, humble, and grave are they who are indeed taught of God.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59605:56"/>
                  <p n="12">12. And thus having briefly prepared the true Chriſtian with a proſpect given him of the nature, uſe, and neceſſitie of true Spirituall Illuminations, tranſlating him out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſſe into the marvellous light of ſaving Knowledge and Faith, before due progreſſe can be made to the life and power of Faith in holy Converſation; and likewiſe ſhewed the hazards of miſcarrying through miſtaken Light; I proceed to the Second Part of Chriſtian walking with God, by walking according to that Light, conſiſting principally in Spirituall Purgation or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

                  <p>O Allmighty God and Heavenly Father, the Light and life of the world lying in darkneſſe: Who by thy Son Jeſus Chriſt coming into the world, enlighteneſt every one that cometh into the world: and whome to know is eternall Life. But who can know thee the Father but the Son and he to whome he ſhall reveale him? and yet none can come unto the Son unleſſe the Father draw him: and none doth the Father draw unto him but by his holy Spirit, teaching all things. Send down, I beſeech thee, that Spirit of light, life and truth into my minde and heart, that they may preſerve me, prevent, and informe me, and rule me: that by that key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the door of my heart may be opened, and the eyes of my underſtanding to perceive the things of God, which are only ſpiritually diſcerned; and that I may not love darkneſſe rather than light, becauſe my deeds are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. But grant that in thy light I may ſee Light, and know how to chooſe the good and refuſe the Evill; not calling darkneſſe, light: nor light, darkneſſe; nor bitter, ſweet; nor ſweet bitter; nor good, evill; nor evill, good.

And how ſhould we come unto thee but through Jeſus Chriſt, who is made unto us of God, Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification and Redemption?

For I thy ſervant and ſon of thy handmaid, am a feeble perſon and of ſhort time, and too young and weak for the underſtanding of judgement and thy Lawes: O ſend her out of thy holy heavens: and from the throne of thy glorie: that being preſent ſhe may labour with me that I may know what is pleaſing unto thee, and what is that good and acceptable will of God.

Applying then our ſelves to ſo Divine and neceſſary a work; before we can doe what is required, we muſt judge what is amiſſe; and being now about to <hi>purge our ſelves from filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 7. 1. we are firſt of all to be throughly perſwaded of thoſe ſpots, and blemiſhes which are to be cleanſed from the ſoule, and thoſe ſcales which are to be taken off our Eyes: and thoſe infirmities and diſtempers our ſouls naturally labour under. For we ſee not, if we lament not our rude, and polluted naturall ſtate; our defects and deformities, and finde the ſmart of our ſores: there is little probabilitie we ſhould be ſollicitous ſo far about our ſelves, as to ſeek for redreſſe and remedie for the ſame; but having attained this, that which followes in the mentioned words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>viz. perfecting holineſſe in the fear of the Lord,</hi> may happily ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>And this advantage by the ſame words is put into our hands towards ſo great and good work, as to learne the generall diviſion of our ſins and impurities to be removed: and that ſome ſins have the reſemblance of a ſpirituall nature, and others, of a fleſhly: For according to the diverſe conſtitution of Man conſiſting of Soule and Bodie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he partaketh both of the nature of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Beaſt, ſo are his inclinations; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59605:61"/> tranſporting him to the exceſſes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Spirits, and ſometimes ſinking him down towards brutiſh luſts: but which are inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated unto us by St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 3. 15. thus writing, <hi>This wiſdome deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſuall, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh.</hi> Whereby we underſtand that ſome ſins, and eſpecially they of the minde of man, are really devilliſh; as having the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill as well for their Authour as Actour, <hi>viz.</hi> Envyings, Gloryings, Strife, Lying inſtanced in by St. <hi>James,</hi> a little before; and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the like nature. And on the other ſide, Hatred, Murthers, Violences offered to others, Intemperance, Incontinence, and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and ſuch like, are ſuch which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuall appetites diſpoſe us unto and we have in common with beaſts prone to them. Yet to the ſhame of Man may it be ſpoken, beaſts many times governed by their ſenſes being not ſo great offenders thereby as men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to higher and better things both by Reaſon, and Religion, or Faith. For in trueth, there is a fourfold reſtraint appointed by God for the keeping us within due compaſſe of living. Firſt, our very Senſes not made by evill cuſtomes more brutiſh than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they are, doe certifie by a naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancie, when we exced due meaſure in the uſe of ſenſible pleaſures. And a greater light, and check to ſuch exorbitances, does our
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59605:61"/> Reaſon give us, not bribed by corruption to give falſe reports and dictates. But the Light and Rules of Faith are yet more clear, full, and perfect to direction and ſanctification: but the life and Crown of all is the Grace of God bringing the will of man into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and obedience. Moſt of which we ſhall here ſpeak briefly to.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. Of the Office and Power of Faith in purging the Soule from ſinfull defilements.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. FAith (as we have ſhewed) is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, of heavenly extraction: It is the gift of God, and not owing originally to the will or election of man: And it is given as an Inſtrument to work the work of God: And this it doth, well applyed and improved, by the Illumination alreadie ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and diſcoveries of Gods Will, and our Dutie in a clearer and fuller manner than otherwiſe we could attain to. But this is not all; this is not the greateſt or chiefeſt part of its Power and vertue; but that which impells and enables us too, to doe the Will of God; For as Chriſt our Lord and Maſter ſaies, <hi>He ſent me into the world to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto the trueth,</hi> and that not by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59605:62"/> only, but by exemplarie holineſſe conſummated in dying for the trueth; ſo ſhould every good Chriſtian, by doing, and dying, if need be, teſtifie to the trueth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And ſurely, great is the influence true and ſtrong Faith hath to that end: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 5. 4. telling us, <hi>This is our victory, even our faith:</hi> ſo termed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the principall meanes whereby we become Conquerors of Gods and our own Enemies: which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4. calls <hi>the pulling down of ſtrong holds, and of every thing that exalteth it ſelfe againſt God</hi> (as all ſinfull luſts doe) <hi>and bringing it into the ſubjection of Chriſt.</hi> For here is verified what Chriſt foretold in the Goſpell, <hi>A mans ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall be they of his own houſe:</hi> A mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Chriſtian never being free from inteſtine jars and warrings of the Law of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers againſt the Law of his minde and faith. So that if we liſten to any ſuggeſtions, or lean on any other aid, but what our Faith furniſhes us withall, we are lyable to fail and fall in our contentions. For as Chriſt ſaid to the Father of the Demoniacall Son. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believeth:</hi> So ſhall we ſee on the contrary, all things are impoſſible to him that disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth: it being ſaid of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 5. <hi>He could doe there</hi> (viz. in his own Country) <hi>no mighty works, becauſe of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59605:62"/> their unbelief:</hi> as if unbelief in man, had tied Gods hands, and diſabled him who is ever omnipotent, to act accordingly: though we muſt underſtand the words of Scripture not abſolutely, but according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Gods proceeding towards man; who muſt not expect that God will obtrude his bleſſings upon him contemning him, as did theſe his Countrymen, who aſtoniſhed at the Wiſdome and Doctrine of Chriſt, carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his Relations and Education, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Perſon and Parentage, believing, with prejudice reproveable by their ſenſes, that Chriſt could not doe that they ſaw him doe; and therefore refuſed to bring forth to him their ſick and impotent, ſo that he could not doe many mighty workes there. And the caſe is the ſame in ſpirituall morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and cures of the diſtempered ſoule: To him that believeth, all things are poſſible, but unbelief makes poſſible things impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and eaſie things, moſt difficult. For Faith not doing its office of declaring to the ignorant minde, the nature of God, an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemie to ſin; and the nature of ſin, an intolerable Enemie to God, man muſt needs be carried away by that falſe naturall light that he hath, after thoſe pleaſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that ſeem, rather than are good to him: And again; He whoſe faith is firme, is alſo operative as well as intuitive, and ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59605:63"/> and excited by it, that he cannot chooſe but he muſt act according to his judgement, perſwaſion, and principle of life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For what was that which moved <hi>Moſes</hi> to forſake <hi>Egypt,</hi> and bid adieu to the Courtly pleaſures of it, and to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, and to eſteem the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt greater riches than the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but that, as the Scripture tells us, <hi>He, by his faith, ſaw him that was inviſible, and by his faith had reſpect unto the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the reward.</hi> He by faith both believed aright in God; and by the ſame, loved what appeared to him moſt noble and deſireable. Which held not good then only, but is of perpetuall truth, as is that of our Saviour Chriſt alſo: <hi>According to thy faith, ſo be it unto thee.</hi> So it is, and ſo it ever will be unto Chriſtian Soules. If a man believes truely but does not fully, his faith is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in its hands and feet, and can profit very little to the main end of Faith. If a man believes firmely, but not ſoundly nor truely, his faith (like to the knowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by our firſt Parents upon the eating of the forbidden fruit) brings him to ſhame and confuſion of face. And of this ſort are innumerable miſtakes, not to be here inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in; that only excepted, which is of moſt generall evill conſequence, whereby men are wont, and willing to divide and rend faith
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59605:63"/> from it ſelfe; I mean the Forme or inward act of believing, from the power and effect of Faith; perſwading themſelves that Faith alone ſo taken, gives us Juſtification; and if ſo, it muſt needs give us Sanctification too. For none are juſtified, but ſuch as are thereunto prepared by a competent degree of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And ſo in trueth at length, it will be found, that whatever is pretended and more dangerouſly preſumed, no man is more Juſtified alone by Faith, than he is Sanctified by it alone: and the workes of Faith are in no place of holy Scripture, oppoſed to Faith it ſelfe, the cauſe of ſuch workes, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our Juſtification: And it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as derogatory to Chriſts merits and the freeneſſe of Gods Grace, to reſt upon ſuch Faith for juſtification and ſalvation, as upon ſuch workes of Faith. But this I ſpeak as I paſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. However therefore the Authours of ſuch Doctrine, or, at leaſt, formes of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as have lately prevailed, diſown the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ill conſequences of the ſame; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yea urge much good workes; and with many flouriſhes commend the uſe of them, yet advancing immoderately and injudiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Act of Faith, creeple it, and binde it up from the free courſe and full influence it may, and otherwiſe would, have upon mens lives, to the purging of the Soule
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59605:64"/> from evill, and impregnating it to good works of vertue and holineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But leaving that Controverſie, let us proceed to what is without Controverſie, ſhewing, by plain inſtances what we have propounded concerning the power of Faith in our militant ſtate here. And let it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly judged, how a man, by Faith thorowly convinced of that one firſt Principle, that there is a God, Creatour of all things, Judge of all things, and of all Men eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and their hearts and actions, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly rewarding the good, and the evill, can eaſily omitt the good ſo amply hereafter to be remunerated; or raſhly fall into the evill of Sin-tempting, ſtanding by his Chriſtian Faith aſſured, that his temporary trifling, vaniſhing as ſoon as felt pleaſures, ſhall end infallibly in bitterneſſe, and never-failing ſorrowes. Who would ſow that ſeed in his Field, which he might eaſily believe will riſe up to an harveſt of Serpents, which will ſting him to death? Or can a man ſtedfaſtly believe that Article of his Creed teaching and aſſuring him, that Chriſt that righteous Judge, ſhall appear a ſecond time in glorie and ſevere Juſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards quick and dead; rendering to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to the good or evill he hath done in his bodie, <hi>viz.</hi> Life Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, or ſhame and torment everlaſting, and not feare? or fear, and yet committ
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59605:64"/> ſuch things, as will weigh him down into the place of ſuch miſerie? What wiſe man would be tempted ſo with the beautie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireableneſſe of drinking out of a Golden Cup, when he knowes it is filled with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Poiſon. Or would any man eat of that bread fair to the Eye and perhaps pleaſant to the palate, which he knowes will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after breed gravell and ſtones in his reins and bladder, and infinitely torture him? Certainly ſuch a mans perſwaſion (which in Religion we call Faith) muſt needs be verie weak, and his fondneſſe, ſtrong, which can impoſe ſo hard things on him, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. No more can any man have a ſound and ſufficient perſwaſion of the heavenly Manſions and the unſpeakable Glories thereof, yea the perfection and beautie of Vertue, and Divineneſſe of holie Life, and good Conſcience, and neglect or contemn the ſame for the fallacies, vitious practices put on the outward ſenſes, for a moment, or leſſe, if leſſe we can imagine. Is not this next to a Miracle, if we may allow the Devill to be able to work Miracles, contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Schools? For what way we call a Miracle, if not deluding the ſenſes, and ſo far changing the natures of things to mans eye and common ſenſe, that he ſhall call good evill, and evill, good: and have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59605:65"/> opinion of Flames, into which he muſt be caſt, than of a Feather bed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To him that lives by Senſe, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſweet is moſt ſweet, and the preſent bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moſt bitter: but to him that lives by Faith and not by Senſe, the future exceeds in both kinds: And, to a truly wiſe man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worſt of troubles and hardſhips in this world, no more to be compared to the miſeries wicked men ſuffer hereafter, than the joyes of ſin in this life are to the glorie to be hereafter enjoyed in Heaven by the Righteous, it may ſeem moſt reaſonable to chooſe the leaſt of Evills, and to run the leaſt of hazards too: as that poore, ſimple au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere man vilely and coldly clad, and as ill fed, did; with whom (as our own hiſtories tell) a boiſterous and ſoft Gallant meeting, demanded of him, Why he uſed himſelfe ſo hardly? and was anſwered by him, I doe this to eſcape Hell-fire. But, ſaid the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant again, If there be no Hell; what a Fool art thou to uſe thy ſelfe ſo ill? But he more wittily and ſharply replied, But what if there be an Hell, how much more Fool art thou to live ſo as thou doeſt? Put the caſe to common Reaſon, (for true Faith is infallibly aſſured of it) that it was a doubtfull point, Whether there were an Hell or not; a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or no Heaven; and the Scales weighing both ſides were equall: would not generall
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59605:65"/> Reaſon adviſe ſo to believe as to take the ſafeſt courſe, and live that life which may lead to the ſuppoſed happineſſe, and eſcape the threatened torments? What hurt befalls that man that lives continently, temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, modeſtly, juſtly, ſoberly, yea and ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyingly as to thoſe things which are not neceſſarie; though no reward followes upon his rigours, but the ordinary comforts of health and peace of minde which are greater to him than the riotous liver and pleaſer of his appetites and ſenſes without reſtraint? But what hurt doth not befall him hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who by indulging to his ſenſible Soule, bereaves himſelfe of everlaſting happineſſe in the world to come? that not being all neither, as our Religion truely informes us.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Let us therefore truely examine our ſelves, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth, <hi>whether we be in the faith, and prove our ſelves, knowing of our own ſelves, that Jeſus Chriſt is in us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we be reprobates?</hi> 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 13. 5. Surely if Chriſt be in us, it muſt be by Faith: and if Faith be in us, it will diſcover ſo much of the events of an holy, and wicked life, as not to be like <hi>a Horſe and Mule which have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> nor like ſuch men who have loſt their underſtanding: but like to that Great Example ſet by Chriſt, for imitation here, and ſalvation hereafter.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. That in purifying our ſelves, principall care is to be taken of the puritie of our Faith; and of the affections of the Inward Man, not neglecting outward ſeverities.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. FAith is not only by the Reformed very often, but ſometimes by the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed alſo of great note, compared to, and call'd an Hand: But if this hand of Faith be all on the taking ſide, and little on the giving, (both which are properties equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſpirituall hand) then is it verie defective. For the Philoſopher termed the hand of the Bodie, the Organ of Organs, or Inſtrument of all other Inſtruments uſefull to us; and ſuch is Faith to our ſpirituall life and actions, given us to work the work of God with. If therefore it be only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to receive Chriſt, and juſtification by him, to the quietation of the ſollicitous and troubled Conſcience; and not to prepare the way by diligent and dutifull actions, our faith being firſt unfaithfull to God, will in the end alſo prove treacherous to our own Souls. And that Inſtrument which is blunt or ill framed in it ſelfe is very apt to marr the work intended. Without a good Pen, a man, how expert ſoever, cannot make a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59605:66"/> good letter; and much leſſe write a fair hand. And not only an hereticall Faith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the true Faith, but an Orthodox and ſound, yet barren, credulous, preſumptuous, unactive, impatient of both good and evill, fond, contumacious, turbulent, or unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary querulous, and quarrelſome, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and reſted on, drawes neerer to perdition than ſalvation, how flattering ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it may appear to the owner of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And on the other ſide, blinde zeal, and violence rather than zeal going about to reforme the Soule with an unreformed or unſanctified Faith, doe oftentimes expoſe the Bodie and Soule to unprofitable and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous injuries: perhaps upon a miſtake of perfection commended to us in the Holy Goſpell. For inſtance; If a man ſhould put out his own Eyes, leſt they ſhould, or becauſe they had miſled him; or to the end he might become a better Philoſopher, as they write of ſome Philoſophers, and it is ſaid of <hi>Didymus</hi> the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> otherwiſe an holy Chriſtian given to contemplation: or if a man ſhould mutilate himſelfe becauſe he would not be choſen a Biſhop, of which Antiquitie gives us inſtances, or to prevent or to revenge acts of unlawfull Luſts, ſhould deſtroy what Nature hath ordained: or, in fine, ſhould, having fallen into any great and ſhamefull ſin, think to make propitiation for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59605:67"/> the ſame by laying violent hands upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, all this muſt be imputed rather to want, than abundance of Faith; and to impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence accumulating ſin unto ſin, till the Soule ſinks under the weight, which by true Faith might have been removed or lightened.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The inordinate paſſions therefore of the minde are to be the task of every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; and the purging or chaſtizing of the irregular appetites; and caſting out of doors, and ſo purging the Temple of God, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> did the profane Stuffe of <hi>Tobiah</hi> the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> out of the Chambers of the Houſe of the Lord polluted thereby. Severall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates there are which either creep in for entertainment, or perhaps plead preſcription, which muſt be diſlodged, or there will in a ſhort time, be found no room for the Maſter of the Houſe himſelfe to reſide in, or rule over the Soule. To waſh the outſide of the Bouls, Platters, and Cups, is not amiſſe, for it is required of every man not only to be religious but to appear ſo, leſt he comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condemnation of thoſe who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of Chriſt, his Doctrine, and holie Diſcipline; but to content our ſelves with that pittance of performance, is to rank our ſelves with the Phariſees and Hypocrites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Chriſt. Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them, was the wiſh of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to his peculiar people the <hi>Iſraelites;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59605:67"/> Deuteron.</hi> 5. 19. when they promiſed fair, and ſpake well concerning obedience, which God requires. But not the obedience of the tongue, which without the heart ends only in aery Complements abſurdly uſed towards men, and ridiculouſly towards God, when the heart is far from him. And far is that heart, (and muſt needs be ſo) from God, which is unclean: and unclean it muſt needs be, which entertains ſuch a Rabble of luſts; which, like drunken Companions in Taverns or Alehouſes, quarrel notoriouſly one with another: but agree to foul the Room with their Pipes, Pots, Glaſſes, Liquor, and perhaps with their own vomit and other evacuations. The ſober man ſeeing this diſorder and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch noiſe and havock, ſayes, I would not be bound to dwell there, if I might have never ſo much. And can we think that Gods pure and piercing Eye beholding ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Spirit, and diſorders which the luſts of the fleſh make in the Soule, and the uncleanneſſe contracted thereby, can, or will condeſcend to take up his habitation there? <hi>Into a malicious Soule wiſdome ſhall not enter; nor dwell in the bodie which is ſubject to ſin, Wiſdome</hi> 1. 4. For all ſin conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of two things contrary to Wiſdome, and to God the Fountaine of Wiſdome, Folly and Foulneſſe; which cannot conſiſt with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Holineſſe, and the true Wiſdome which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59605:68"/> cometh from <hi>above, and is firſt pure, and then peaceable, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it were therefore only becauſe God ſo frequently, ſo earneſtly, ſo preſſingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires inward Puritie; Puritie of intention and underſtanding, which qualifie exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly actions otherwiſe irregular, and faulty; Puritie of affections freed from ſmuttie dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, and cleer and ſincere and fixed and fervent towards the beſt Objects, and that upon the beſt Grounds and Motives, Gods ſervice and honour; who well adviſed would not apply himſelfe to ſo noble, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a task as the ſearching and trying his heart, and caſting out thence whatever may cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. And this may be another Motive to interiour holineſſe; the powerfull influence, the inward temper and diſpoſition of the minde hath upon all exteriour actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evill. For according to the Regencie of the minde, is the obedience of the outward man; as our moſt wife and holie Maſter Chriſt informes us, ſaying, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 21. <hi>From within, out of the heart of men, proceed evill thoughts, adulteries, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, murders, thefts, covetouſneſſe, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deceit, laſciviouſneſſe, an evill eye, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemie, pride, fooliſhneſſe. All theſe evill
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59605:68"/> things come from within, and defile the man.</hi> All ſin defiles, but principally, and in the firſt place, the inward man; and thence as from a bitter or corrupt Fountain-head, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and impure actions doe flow. Or as we ſee in Clocks and Watches, the Hand outward pointing to the hour, goes true or falſe according to the Spring, and inward frame of them: ſo our externall practices are right, juſt, and holy: or, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, falſe and depraved, according to the corrupt or ſound principles of Reaſon and Faith, and the ſober affections of the heart purified by Faith. For untill the Spirit of Sanctification, and mortification and renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath wrought our corrupt nature to a bleſſed and thorow change, little may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from us outwardly, either acceptable to God, who looks more upon the manner and forme of the Deed, than the Deed it ſelfe; or profitable to our ſelves. For, (to continue a little farther our ſimilitude) as we ſee men having bad Watches, will with their Finger or Thumb place the Hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to give ſome credit to them which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, according to their ill frame, returne to their wonted errour. So Hypocrites, to appear fair and good to men, puſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on ſometimes to regular and laudable acts, and ſometimes reſtrain and ſet back their rank courſe of ſin, for ſome imperfect, if
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59605:69"/> not evill end, but ſoon relapſe to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed exceſſes, for want of the principle of holineſſe, and a conſtitution heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, the only true Spring of good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable actions.</p>

Again, The inward man may well be compared to the Market-place of a ſtrong Citie; The Enemie may ſurpriſe, or by ſome ſuddain violence, may poſſeſſe himſelfe of the out-workes, and yet be repelled again, and the Citie ſtand firme and ſafe, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to its Soveraign; but if the Enemie once poſſeſſes himſelfe of the Market-place, there is no hopes of ſtanding true to the Owner, or withſtanding the Adverſarie. So is it with them who have ſuffered the Legions of foul Spirits to enter into their hearts, and there to neſtle and triumph. All attempts are but feeble and inſufficient to exhibit juſt and reaſonable ſervice to God. For no ſooner doe ſome good inclinations ariſe, no ſooner doe we offer at good, but a partie of vain thoughts, diſhoneſt motions, are ſent forth to ſuppreſſe all good but weak purpoſes of returning to our allegiance to God, and the doing of his Will. Great circumſpection therefore muſt be uſed, ſtrong reſolutions muſt be taken, and many difficulties of hunger, thirſt, and hot ſervice muſt firſt be paſſed through, before our Redemption draweth nigh, and we be reſtored to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59605:69"/> Maſterie of our ſelves, and the miniſtrie we owe to God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But adde hereunto, fourthly, a more intrinſick argument to the ſtirring us up to the cleanſing our hearts; the great benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to a mans ſelfe, who ſhall ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitt himſelfe. For however this conflict with the powers of fleſh and blood, and this Conqueſt is very difficult and tedious, and therefore is called in Scripture, <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and crucifying the Old man with the affections and luſts;</hi> yet the work once done, and the victory obtained, brings wonderfull eaſe, quiet, ſatisfaction, and cheerfulneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit, rendering it much more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and lightſome than it was before, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt a contrarie Principle, which ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more clogged it, obſtructed, and either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impeded, or grievouſly retarded the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Divine Services. For men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce able to extinguiſh the cleer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Deity in them, and little leſſe able to deny wholly ſuch a ſervice as is due to God, doe with an unwilling will, divers times, ſubmit to Religious acts: but weariſome and tedious are they to them, through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valencie of unſubdued luſts; which by this neceſſary Diſcipline being maſter'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, a great change is made in the Soule; and then, with lightneſſe and readineſſe, is that done which before was irkſome and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59605:70"/> grievous. As <hi>David</hi> himſelfe found it in himſelfe, when he ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 32. <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandements, when thou haſt ſet my heart at liberty.</hi> And then are our hearts at liberty, when the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant <hi>Hagar,</hi> with her off-ſpring, which would domineer, are caſt out. Then are we free indeed, when the Son ſhall make us free; then doth the Son make us free, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us fo far, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. 4. as <hi>by a Divine nature given unto us, we eſcape the corruption that is in the world, through luſt.</hi> Then ſhall we not fear the Law of the Land conſtraining us to Gods ſervice, more than God; then ſhall we not ſhrinke and murmure at Faſting-dayes, nor repine when, on dayes of publique Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to him that is glorious in all his Saints, it is expected we ſhould ſuſpend and intermitt our lawfull labours, and wholly cut off and denie our unlawfull pleaſures. We ſhall not need then, as Beaſts under the Leviticall Law, one, or more to drive us to the Houſe of God, nor drag us with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Altar of God, to offer an holy, living and acceptable ſacrifice to him, which is our reaſonable ſervice: But with <hi>Davids</hi> Spirit, we ſhall ſay, <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, Let us goe up unto the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> And how much better is it, we ſhould doe a thing with Alacritie and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59605:70"/> great content, than with conſtraint? But this we may doe, if we can but free our ſelves from that load of corruption we are apt to lye under. And what effect in this kinde and progreſſe a man hath made in himſelfe, may be competently diſcerned from the ſenſe a man hath in himſelfe, of the fear of God, and love to his ſervice and worſhip: which though the moſt pure and perfect in this life, is not without ſome tepiditie of ſpirit ſometimes; yet the ſeed of God ſown in the heart will generally ſpring up with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This therefore ſhould be our great and chiefe endeavour which is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> And if, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> Chap. 18. 21. <hi>Death and life are in the power of the tongue,</hi> much more true is it, that both of them are in the power of the Heart; as it ſtands affected or diſaffected to God: ſeeing the Poiſon or Balſome which diſtilleth from the Tongue is originally owing to the Heart: as the Heart doth comprehenſively ſignifie the entire bodie of affections, which muſt be dedicated to God. But given to God it cannot be,, without a mock or deriſion, but as it is whole and ſound; clear, and clean, according to the ballance of the Sanctuarie of the Goſpell, which conſiſts much of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59605:71"/> Equitie. We never heard of any that liv'd a life of nature with halfe an heart only; neither of any that was ſick on one ſide of his heart, and well on the other: no more is it poſſible to pleaſe God with one part of our heart, and to pleaſe the world with the other; or at the ſame time, to live the life of this ſinfull world, and of Chriſt: <hi>My ſon</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>give me thy heart;</hi> and not a piece of it: for that muſt needs be dead fleſh, odious to man, and much more to God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. SUCH is the contagion of ſin natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infecting the very Soule, as inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Forefathers corruption, that being in love with it, (as all men love that which is naturall to them) there is but ſmall hopes a man ſhould be able, or ſo much as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to help himſelfe out of that evill ſtate. The wiſeſt Phyſicians admit of Counſell and aſſiſtance from others, when they are in any languiſhing condition: And ſome Sores or Wounds there may be of the Bodie, which a mans one hand cannot come at to dreſſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59605:71"/> or cleanſe; and therefore needeth the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of others: And this is the caſe of the corrupted Soule by Nature. <hi>This is thy wickedneſſe</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> Cap. 4. 18.) <hi>becauſe it is bitter, becauſe it reacheth unto thine heart:</hi> It is every mans caſe, <hi>Thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelfe, but of me is thine help.</hi> God muſt, and doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us to a new life, and ſalvation, by his own Counſell and Hand: and a Laver of Regeneration, a Sacrament of Baptiſme hath he ordained to the cleanſing of our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall defilement, and purging our inward man, which no outward miniſtry, not ennobled with Divine Vertue, can reach or remedie. This was propheſied and promiſed by God in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 13. 1. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a Fountain opened to the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and to the inhabitants of Hieruſalem for ſin and uncleanneſſe:</hi> And this we, to our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſatisfaction and comfort, finde accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the pure water of Baptiſme: the force and effect whereof we are well taught by our Engliſh Catechiſme, which ſayes: <hi>Being by nature borne in ſin and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, we are hereby made the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Grace.</hi> And Children of Grace we are not made, but by ſuch purification which proceedeth from the blood of Chriſt ſhed for the expiation of our filthineſſe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. And the Blood of Chriſt is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59605:72"/> effectuall to our cleanſing, than as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by that which repreſents it, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: So that the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. 10, 11. having deſcribed the lamentable and foule ſtate of the naturall man in Fornication, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, Adulterie, Effeminateneſſe, abuſings of Mankinde, Thefts, Covetouſneſſe, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſſe, Extortions, whereof whoever is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhall not enter (that ſpot and guilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining) into the Kingdome of Heaven, addes, to our humiliation and comfort at the ſame time. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, by the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God;</hi> which plainly directs us to Baptiſme, Waſhing and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying from all uncleanneſſe of Nature. And therefore none were ever admitted into the number of Chriſts flock or holy Fold, the Church, but ſuch as were ſo ſanctified: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the frequent errours of the Moderne Divinity, which denies the power of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mundification, to Baptiſme, and of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning ſins: reſtraining its vertue to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications only of remiſſion of ſins, by Chriſt; and the Incorporation of us into the Church, which is the Body of Chriſt. Which Doctrine, as very new and contrary to the faith of the Ancient Church, and ſo many clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe places of Scripture, aſcribing a power of cleanſing and pardoning unto that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59605:72"/> I wonder how men of Learning and Conſcience could readily maintain: And that is all I ſhall at preſent ſay againſt that Dogme; avoiding here all contentions, and purſuing the plain trueths uſefull for our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And this leads us to another effect of Baptiſme upon the Soule, which concernes actuall tranſgreſſions; as well as originall ſin removed thereby. For not only is that ſin actuall and originall which we bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, purged away at the time of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but by vertue of the Covenant God makes with us then, we are in a capacitie to purge our ſelves (Gods grace alwayes ſuppoſed as concurring with us) and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain remiſſion of ſins, and reconciliation to Allmighty God, by repentance, whoſe effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie to that purpoſe, depends abſolutely on preceding Baptiſme; ſo that Repentance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward attended by change of heart, and life, can ordinarily be of no power to reconcile us to God, but as we are before baptized into Chriſt: whatever God may doe by his extraordinary and unrevealed Will, not to be relied upon, without adding ſin unto ſin, and that of preſumption, tending to a new provocation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the manner of ſo expiating ſin committed after Baptiſme, is yet farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved from the Sinners ſerious reflection
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59605:73"/> upon the ſolemne Vow made in Baptiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and himſelfe, of forſaking the World, Fleſh, and Devill, and all ſinfulneſſe occaſioned by them. For what ingenuous Chriſtian calling to minde what God hath in that Holy Sacrament done for him, or what he hath vowed to God, but will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bethink himſelfe how to demean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe agreeable to ſuch Covenants; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently apply himſelfe to thoſe Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon him? And to this St. <hi>Paul</hi> would argue us, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cuſtome among men, ſaying, <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men, though it be but a mans Covenant, yet if it be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no man diſannulleth or addeth thereto.</hi> According to the generall Law of Nations, it is baſe, and diſhoneſt, and very dangerous, to break the Agreement made, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and forge new termes, never conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to by the other Party. And how can we thinke but God ſhould make good what he threatens his own people, <hi>viz. Avenge the quarrell of his Covenant, Levit.</hi> 26. 25. So that God having thus freely premiſed his pardon of our ſins, and waſhed us with pure water, and moreover, furniſhed us with ſuch a <hi>Fund</hi> of Grace, then given us; and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with actuall Graces ſuperadded to the generall, what ſhould more prevaile upon us than to improve them all as well to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59605:73"/> clearing us from our former evills, as reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manifold temptations occurring in our Chriſtian warfare? For by Baptiſme and the Vow made therein, hath God put a word into our Mouthes of trueth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereby we may confound ſin and Satan: he hath put a Sword into our hands, wherewith we may ſtrike through the Loins of the Old Man: he hath made us more than Conquerours; and more than clean, in that, <hi>Naaman</hi>-like, a Miracle is wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by the true <hi>Jordan</hi>-ſtreams, in renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our leprous and foule fleſh, to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine puritie: and granting unto us that we may ſo preſerve our ſelves when we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall into the mire of ſin; by vertue of an efficacious Repentance, made ſo by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: of which in the next place we are briefly to ſpeak.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. O Divine! O Bleſſed Repentance! How like our Bleſſed Saviour, art thou deſpiſed indeed, and rejected of men, a Ladie of ſorrowes, and acquainted with griefs? How doe we deſpiſe thee, as one
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59605:74"/> of no beautie, that we ſhould deſire thee? <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. How beautifull art thou in the Eyes of God? How powerfull in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God? For as God ſeeth not as man ſeeth; ſo loveth he not as man loveth. With vain man, that perſon is lovely and enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which hath a well featur'd face, a freſh look, a ruddie Complexion, bright and ſprightly Eyes, and ſuch like ornaments of Nature; which if they be not accurate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, recourſe is had commonly to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices imitating and excelling Nature. But with God lovely are the Eyes ſwelled with weeping: the moiſtened and blurred Face, the drooping Head, neglected Attire, pale Countenance, and dejected, not daring ſo much as to lift it ſelfe up to Heaven, ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes on the Body, inſtead of Silks and gorgeous Apparell; and aſhes on the Head, and halfe-formed language directed to God, through confuſion of minde and oppreſſion of ſpirits under the ſenſe of ſin and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences committed againſt God. This is the thing God is moſt in love with; this is the Image, methinks, I could worſhip above any other repreſentation; and by mediation of which, I ſhould hope to have greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God than by the interceſſion of the moſt eminent and renowned Saint in Heaven. For if Saints can help and befriend us ſeeking to them, they cannot prevail
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59605:74"/> for us before God, but as we repent: but certainly Repentance may prevail with God without them. <hi>Though thou waſh thee with nitre</hi> (<hi>Jerem.</hi> 2. 22, 23.) <hi>and takeſt much ſope, yet thine iniquitie is marked before me, ſaith the Lord. How canſt thou ſay, I am not polluted? But, Take to you words</hi> [of Repentance] <hi>and turne to the Lord: ſay unto him, take away all iniquitie, and receive us graciouſly, &amp;c.</hi> and you ſhall be ſaved from your ſins. Offer to God all the Beaſts of the Field, and the Sheep upon a thouſand Hills; yea take the fruit of thy Bodie and offer it and them all, as a ſacrifice of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Almighty God for the ſin of your Soule, and it ſhall not be received: but the ſacrifice of a broken ſpirit, and contrite heart, O Lord, thou wilt not deſpiſe. And what ſhould I mention, in this caſe, the treaſures of Princes, of no account with God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Repentance to finde favour before him, or to cleanſe us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who is there then that ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Repentance, which removes all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternations and fears? Who is there that ſhould be aſhamed of the deformities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſo beautifull in the eyes of God? or the baſeneſſe of it, ſo exalted and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God? 'Tis true, <hi>At firſt ſhe will walke with him by crooked wayes</hi> (<hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 4.) <hi>and bring fear and dread upon him, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59605:75"/> him with her diſcipline, untill ſhe may truſt his ſoule, and trye him by her lawes: then will ſhe return the ſtrait way unto him, and comfort him, and ſhew him her ſecrets.</hi> For what can be more eaſie, or equall, or comfortable than what St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 Ep. 1. 8, 9. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the trueth is not in us: But if we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But all this while (though the danger be not ſo common or great as the contrary, undervaluing and neglecting Repentance) caution is here to be uſed, while we thus applaud and magnifie Repentance and the power of it, leſt we aſcribe too much unto it. For here may Repentance curing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers and purifying the pollutions of the Soule, ſay with the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3. healing the impotent man, <hi>Not by our own power or holineſſe have we made this man to walk:</hi> But by the power and inſtitvtion of God, is the great cure wrought by it upon the Soules of the penitent. For what is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of it ſelfe? Even as vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible a thing as it appears to be; as courſe and uncomely, as unhappie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, and unprofitable to ſuch great ends, as it ſeems. What can a melanchollie look contribute to the cleering Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59605:75"/> towards a Sinner? Or what can a wounded heart conduce to the healing of the diſeaſes of the Soule? What ſatisfaction for the wrong done to God, can wringing of hands, beating the Breſt, ſackcloth and aſhes, ſevere Penances, liberall Almes, (very commendable in ſuch caſes) avail to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the injuries done to God, our Neigb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or our own Soules? How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible theſe things ſhould reſtore innocency to the Perſon, or integrity and puritie? No ſurely. But God ſeeing man plunged into debt with him, in ten thouſand Talents, and having nothing to pay, ſo condeſcendeth to the neceſſities and extremities of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and forlorne Creatures, as to raiſe up one Mighty to ſave, poor in Spirit, and rich in Mercies and Merits, which he extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the relief of us lying under guilt and Gods heavie diſpleaſure: but yet not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and inconditionately, but we ſhould concurre by our endeavours to put efficacie actually into the generall meanes ordained by God to our reſtauration and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: amongſt which none is more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with the Father of Free Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, than Repentance, and that quicken'd and enlivened by ſuch adjuncts and fruits mentioned. For who ſhall except againſt God, if he pleaſes that ſo many Cyphers of our penitent actions and humiliations, ſhall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59605:76"/> ſtand for round Numbers tending towards the payment of our debts? Baptiſme by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall water is but a poor and beggerly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſelfe, to waſh away originall Sin: but God may, and hath elevated it to a noble and Divine Effect. So the baptiſme of Repentance is altogether inſufficient to ſuch high Ends as waſhing the Soule, but by Gods Inſtitution, it becomes thereunto effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, to a miracle.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whatever therefore may be pretended of free Grace on Gods part, and feared of ſuperſtition, on mans part, in diſciplining the Soule by outward auſterities, ſuch as afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body to bring i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> under ſubjection to the minde, and rebating fleſhly concupiſcences and motions towards Sin; Watchings, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Confeſſions to God and man, Prayers, forgiving others that have offended us, Almes and ſuch like Chriſtian acts and exerciſes, as inconſiſtent with Chriſts full ſatisfaction upon the Croſſe, it is more inconſiſtent with the Goodneſſe and Grace of God to oppoſe theſe: and may in like manner tend to the abolition of that ſmall pretence to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Prayers, yea Faith it ſelfe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch ſelfe-ſecuring Scruplers. The power indeed of Faith and Repentance is in a manner infinite, through Gods Power and Grace influencing them: but God workes rather by his own preſcription, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59605:76"/> to our imagination, and fond Faith, naked of ſuch a proper retinue as is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. It is abundantly ſufficient to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous mindes, and throughly repenting, that God will admitt them to the benefit of Repentance, upon the uſe of it in deepeſt manner, and with all its circumſtances: and therefore for men to ſpeak evill of that way; and to ſtudie for excuſes from ſeverer pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and to declaim againſt them as dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie to Chriſts merits, may provoke God to denie that grace of acceptance, which in many caſes, he granteth unto Penitents. For God hath wiſely and juſtly hid from every mans Eyes the preciſe and particular termes of our reconciliation with him: neither hath he declared preciſely all the qualities and circumſtances of that humiliation upon which he will acquitt and abſolve us. But God undoubtedly doth remitt offences to ſome mens repentance, which he will not doe to anothers, by reaſon of the varietie of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the perſons. As for inſtance, If a man heinouſly offending God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge, opportunity, means and ſpeciall motives to exerciſe and demonſtrate the ſame, ſhall ſpeak lightly of that way, and with preſumption rather than Faith, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely lay all the dutie on ſome inward trouble of minde, I may juſtly fear ſuch a mans repentance will fail him, and fruſtrate
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59605:77"/> his expectation: though, in ſome caſes and of ſome perſons, it may be accepted. No greater evill ſurely to Gods grace, and mans well-grounded faith is there, than to have recourſe to what God can doe, and what Chriſt hath done; and ſo therein to reſt, as wilfully to forbear what they themſelves ought to doe. And men ought to doe what in them ordinarily lies, to the recovery of their fall, and ſtanding right in the Court and favour of God, neither attributing too much to ſuch outward workes wrought; nor too confidently laying claim to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and amplitude of Gods favour, unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified wholly for the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Two eminent Examples Ancient ſtories afford us, for the better regulating our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and actions in this Caſe. The one is of Father <hi>Paemen</hi> in the Apothegmes of the Fathers: To whom one coming, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing a great ſin, whereinto he had lately fallen, humbled himſelfe before him, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, that for ſo doing, he would doe Penance for three yeers. No (ſaid the old Father,) it is too much. A yeer then, ſaid the other: It is too much, ſaid he. Fourtie dayes, ſaid the offender; It is too much, I tell you (ſaid <hi>Paemen</hi>) three dayes Penance, not committing the ſame ſin again (the ſin was Fornication) may ſuffice. No doubt but this reſolution was ſound and good:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59605:77"/> becauſe of a fervent and ſtrong determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taking upon himſelfe a more difficult task and heavie burden, through deep ſenſe of his wickedneſſe, which God principally regards. But ſhould any man ſet ſuch like ſin at ſo low a rate as to contemne much outward trouble; and ſay within himſelfe, that true Repentance is to be ſorrie at large, and not to committ the ſame ſin again; I doubt whether ſuch ſelfe-abſolution, upon ſuch eaſie termes, would be accepted by God. For thoſe who probably have not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into ſuch ſcandalous ſins, but devoted themſelves more entirely and intimately to the ſervice of God, have judged their whole lives not too much to win Gods favour by Repentance, and that of the ſeverer ſort. For <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> in the Life of St. <hi>Ephrem</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> writeth of him, That as it was naturall for all other men to uſe reſpiration, and motion; ſo became it cuſtomarie to him, to weep: ſo that there was ſcarce any day or any night, or any conſiderable part of day or night, or very ſhort time, in which he did not ſhed teares: teaching us, that we ought never to reſolve againſt weeping for our ſins; or having confidence in Gods mercy; where the grace of true Repentance is found, and true fruits, though not ſo high and heroicall, (as I may ſo ſpeake) are not wanting. Nothing is more contrarie to the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59605:78"/> free Grace of God or our Dutie than limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him or it, where he hath not circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed himſelfe. To ſay within a mans ſelfe, God will not have mercie upon me, unleſſe I truely repent, is the Doctrine God himſelfe put into a mans mouth, and muſt be held immutably and inviolably: becauſe he hath ſo often ſaid it, and hath limited his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to that condition. But to ſay, To doe thus much in Repentance, or to goe thus far only, is ſufficient without farther trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling fleſh and blood; or, on the contrary, to ſay poſitively, God will not pardon my offences, unleſſe my true repentance be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with, and demonſtrated by ſuch or ſuch outward exerciſes, is to determine what God hath not determined, and to lay the ſtreſſe of obtaining mercie upon uncommand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſervices; as we are taught, by ſome of late dayes, to ſpeake. It is left therefore by God, obſcure; as to the viſible part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, what God will accept, and what he will not, for reconciliation: But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn outward ſeverities, as too many doe, upon a poſſibilitie that God may ſave us without them; may, for ought we know, turne Gods face from approving our preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med-on Repentance inward. For there are ſo many inſtances of Great Sinners, greatly humbled outwardly as well as inwardly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſight of their ſins, in Holy Scripture,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59605:78"/> as well as monuments of the Church, that it is a wonder to me, to obſerve the confidence the moderne divinity of ſome, hath put into the hearts of men, by a prodigall faith, to make up a ſhort and eaſie reckoning between God and them, adding taunts, and reproaches to them who ſurpaſſe them in ſenſible exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and concomitants of inward ſorrow. He therefore is in the ſafeſt way to have his ſoule cleanſed from his ſins; and the ſcores wiped out between God and himſelfe, who ſhall bear ſuch a venerable opinion towards Repentance, ſuch a hatred and deteſtation of ſin, ſuch an equall opinion between the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and goodneſſe of God, as that, by abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of penances impoſed on himſelfe or by others, whoſe judgement he may follow better than his own in ſuch caſes, he cannot merit properly Gods favour; nor, keeping up a faithfull and humble ſpirit towards God in ſincere Repentance not ſo fairly qualified, muſt deſpair of remiſſion. For undoubtedly the contrition of the heart ſhall much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate the bodily exerciſes, weighed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Gods ballance, but 'tis no reaſon at all, becauſe that is principally to be done, that we ſhould leave the latter undone: and that upon ſeverall accounts, not ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting with our preſent deſigne.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59605:79"/>
                  <p n="6">6. But yet in generall, to reconcile men to the complexe dutie of Repentance thus aſſerted, I ſhall offer to the devouter mindes, theſe few Conſiderations of the excellencie of Repentance. As firſt, that Repentance is the greateſt Good God could beſtow upon the lapſed Sinner: ſo that it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether his ſingular love to mankinde had appeared more conſpicuouſly in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fall by a powerfull hand, than by giving him Repentance, to lift him up again. It was much eaſier for man to have perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in the ſtate of Grace at firſt received of God: and ſeems more eaſie to God (if any thing may be ſaid to be difficult to him) to have preſerved man ſo, than to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him. So that of that great evill of man, Apoſtacie from God, this great good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, the manifeſtation of the greatneſſe of his power and mercie in giving repentance unto man; and by ſuch an abject thing in the eyes of the world, to produce ſo glorious effect as the converſion of a Sinner, the very joy and applauſe of the bleſſed Saints and Angells in heaven. Nay, though Chriſt, as a Mediatour and Redeemer, was the pure gift of God to man; yet the influence and effect of Chriſts mediation, God would have to depend wholly on Repentance: as is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in theſe words, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. <hi>Him</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>hath God exalted with his right
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59605:79"/> hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and forgiveneſſe of ſin.</hi> So that as there is no forgiveneſſe without repentance, and there is no ſaving repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance without Chriſt, ſo is there no ſaving Chriſt, without repentance. For this was one end of Chriſts coming into the world, Repentance: as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 20. <hi>The times of former ignorance, God winked at, but now commandeth all men to repent, every where.</hi> And hence it is, that the Apoſtles having heard what ſucceſſe St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> make it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of aſtoniſhment and glorification of All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as it is written, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. <hi>When they heard theſe things they held their peace, and glorified God, ſaying: Then hath God alſo to the</hi> Gentiles <hi>granted repentance unto life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. But farther, let us ſee more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the dignitie of Repentance; in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of which, all the principall Attributes of Allmighty God are engaged: as firſt of all, that which is moſt formidable to a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and conſcious Soule, his Juſtice. For when by foregoing Illumination, the minde of man is brought to the knowledge of the nature of ſin dwelling in it, and the ſtrong oppoſition which is made againſt it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and the fearfull reward due to it, who can but tremble, to finde himſelfe brought
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59605:80"/> under the plagues due to it? But withall, conſidering the wonderfull condeſcenſion of Allmighty God entring into a Covenant of Grace and favour with Sinners, upon the termes of true repentance, and that he will infallibly be as good as his promiſes declare him; the bitterneſſe of his Juſtice is changed into the ſweet waters of Life, to the deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Sinner. For if God had only ſaid as he doth, <hi>Exodus</hi> 34. 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gracious, long ſuffering and abundant in goodneſſe, and trueth. Keeping mercie, for thouſands, forgiving iniquities tranſgreſſion and ſin, and that will by no means cleer the guilty,</hi> &amp;c. the matter had not been ſo wonderfull: For it is imprinted in the mindes of all Believers, that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and Good to all, even to Sinners that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: Allmoſt every Chapter in <hi>Mahomets Alchoran</hi> proclaims that aloud: and this is moſt pleaſant to the ear of a Sinner dejected for his errours; but much more is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing the languiſhing Soule, to hear, that Juſtice it ſelfe is turned to be a Friend to a Sinner; by vertue of repentance: as St. <hi>John</hi> aſſures us, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> However, therefore Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticall doubts and diſputations may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about the manner, how God, out of his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59605:80"/> juſtice, may be ſaid to ſave a man; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted, after ſuch expreſſe words of Scripture, that ſo it is. And that this comes thus to paſſe, that God hath ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and eſteem for his own gift, Repentance; that where ever he finds that, he hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his honour, his trueth, or faithfulneſſe, to his word, and Juſtice it ſelfe to acquitt that Sinner, and cleanſe him from his pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Not unlike to the gift of ſome great Prince, or Perſon, to ſome inferiour one: who in token of his fidelitie to him, and firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all great calamities and diſtreſſes endangering his life, delivereth to him a Ring, or other privie token well known to him, adviſing that if ever he be call'd in queſtion for his life, or like to be oppreſſed by his Enemies, he would ſend him that, or ſhow it him, and it ſhall ſuffice to oblige him to come ſpeedily to his deliverance, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: ſo pleaſeth it Allmighty God, to grant to his friends in Chriſt, this excellent gift of Repentance, which he beholding, is ſo much affected with the dangerous condition of the miſerable Sinner, that in honour and juſtice, he holdeth himſelfe bound to ſecure him from the malice and miſchiefs which his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies long and ſtrain hard to bring upon him.</p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59605:81"/>
                  <p n="8">8. And ſo may we ſay of the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of God, concerned very much in the deliverie of the penitent Sinner. For as there is guilt, danger, and damnation in ſin; ſo is there likewiſe ſhame and confuſion of minde and face, at the apprehenſion of ſo foul errours and odious ſpots as accompanie the commiſſion of ſins: ſo that the ſame pierces into the verie ſoule by its ſtain; and infeſts the Conſcience with intolerable pain, at the apprehenſion of ſuch a ſhamefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. What would an ingenuous Penitent give? yea rather, What would he not give, that he had never offended ſo Great a God, and ſo Good a Father? With what ſhame, (the eyes of his minde being illuminate) doth he reflect upon himſelfe? ſo that it is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable in ſome truely repenting, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſoules, whether the abhorrence of that foul ſtate it findes it ſelfe in, by ſin, be not altogether as intolerable as the foreſeen pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of Hell it ſelfe: In ſuch caſes as this, when all other hopes of being reſtored to its priſtine integrity and purity; ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely deſireable to a true Convert, faileth; relief and remedie is diſcovered in the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of God, which, and none but which, could cauſe the Leprous and filthy parts of <hi>Naaman</hi> to returne to the ſoundneſſe and ſweetneſſe of the fleſh of an Infant; and can as eaſily renew the defaced and defiled
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59605:81"/> Soule; ſo that when one day it ſhall appear naked at the Tribunall of Chriſt, before the ſharp-ſighted Angells and men, they ſhall not be able to diſcerne the leaſt blott or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in the ſame: And why? becauſe, as by a ſecond regeneration after Baptiſme, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance renews the ſoule by Gods powerfull Grace, to a new habit; and is therefore called a Second Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Furthermore, what can be more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of every good Chriſtians practice, than Repentance, which God honoureth above many ſplendid Graces in the ſight of the world; yea, which men, more thorowly ſeen into the divine ſtudy and art of converſing with God, judge to be inferiour to none in dignitie, and above all in neceſſitie? How doe we read of <hi>Davids</hi> Repentance, and <hi>Peters,</hi> reſtoring them entirely to Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? ſo that former ſins which were great, obſtructed not their aſcent to the higheſt pitch of Gods favour, and of Rule and Authority in the Church of God. For doth not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Parable of our Saviour Chriſt in the Goſpell, <hi>Luke</hi> the 15th, of the <hi>loſt Sheep;</hi> of the <hi>loſt Groat,</hi> of the <hi>loſt Son,</hi> prove the certainty to us? all which declare unto us this miſerable ſtate of Sinners fled from God, and unreduced; and the happineſſe and glory, upon their returne, by Repentance; and the joy in heaven and earth upon their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59605:82"/> unto God and goodneſſe, as upon a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wun over the Devill, and a ſoule wun to God.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And if we compare Repentance with other Chriſtian vertues adorning the Soule, we ſhall finde great glorie aſcribed unto it, and ſet at the Right-hand of the very chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: For what is more commended or extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Holy Fathers of old than Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? And yet by Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> Humilitie is preferred before it. And Humilitie is but one branch of the main bodie of Repentance: which therefore muſt much more excell the other: And the ſame have many devout Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites ſaid, as <hi>Palladius</hi> relates.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Laſtly, How ſoure and ſevere ſoever acts of Repentance may, at a diſtance, doe appear to a naturall eye, in the midſt of its clouds and darkneſſe, light doth ſpring out: and when the greateſt agonies for ſin, and the wounds of a Conſcience ſtung with it, ſmart moſt ſorely, there may ariſe this true ground of conſolation, that even this repentance, as bitter as it may ſeem, is a notable inſtance of Gods favour: for God doth not give ſuch ſingular gifts but to his beloved and choſen ones: and that, under his apparent frowns againſt a Sinner repenting, are hidden reall ſmiles of love to ſuch penitents' to whome, if he had not a ſpeciall favour; he would have ſuffered him, with the throng of the world,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59605:82"/> to paſſe without any remorſe, or means of readoption, holineſſe, and happineſſe: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance proves the contrarie. Which may both ſupport the wearied minde, in the midſt of cruſhing ſorrowes; and excite the ſecure to undergoe this eaſie Yoke of Chriſt, (all things conſidered) and reduce the fugitive <hi>Shulamite,</hi> the ſtraying Sheep, unto the Chief Shepheard of our Soules, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI. That this Purgative Repentance muſt be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, of all ſins; and perpetuall.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AS God looks upon ſin, and as ſin looks againſt God; ſo muſt every one that is borne of God, in this, as other things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his heavenly Father. There is no fin but God hateth: there is no Sinner but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and oppoſeth God: there is no ſin but fighteth againſt our Soules, woundeth, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and defileth the ſame: there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Chriſtian but ought to hate all ſin: as <hi>David</hi> may be underſtood, when <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139. he ſaith, <hi>Doe not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee, and am not I grieved, O Lord, with them that riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, even as though they were mine enemies.</hi> So that he not only
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59605:83"/> ſubmitteth to, but, afterward, demandeth a ſearch to be made in his heart, whether any kinde of iniquity lurketh there, perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beknown to him, which ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Learned Maſters of Chriſtian doctrine tell us, that God cannot forgive abſolutely one ſin, and leave another unpardoned; and much leſſe can a man denie one ſin, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace another: no more than a Fornicatour can ceaſe to be ſuch in diſliking one whoriſh Woman, and chooſing another: Nor may he be ſaid to repent, that he hath abuſed his bodie by ſuch unrighteous practices, but that haply, he had to doe with ſuch a perſon: ſo is it with the Sinner that forſaketh not wholly, but changes his ſin: As if he hath in his young and wanton dayes, lived luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and prodigally, and in his declining ſtrength and yeers, ſhould begin (as the Prodigall.) to be in want, or ayme at the raiſing of a Family, and leaving an ample Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie to his Poſterity, and ſo take up; baſely now ſparing, as he ſpent baſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; he may flatter himſelfe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, like a notable Convert and mortified perſon, condemn his youthfull follies, and mad exorbitancies, and moreover ſpeciouſly bleſſe God that he ſees his errour paſt, and ſecurely bleſſe himſelfe in his late wiſdome and abſtinences; but all in vain, yea more
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59605:83"/> perniciouſly than before, if he turnes pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly abſtemious, denying himſelfe many things after the manner of true <hi>Aſceticks,</hi> and renouncers of the world, and all this, out of a new eſpouſed vice, Covetouſneſſe, which infatuates his judgement ſo far as that he <hi>flattereth himſelfe in his own eyes</hi> (as it is <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36.) <hi>till his iniquity be found to be hatefull:</hi> or, <hi>Till his abominable ſin be found out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For God, who abhorreth commutations of Vertue for Vice, much more abhorreth commutation of one Vice for another. Whence it is that Saint <hi>James</hi> ſo expreſly affirmeth, Cap. 2. v. 10, 11. <hi>Whoſoever keepeth the whole Law, and yet offends in one point, is guilty of all. For he that ſaid, Doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt Adultery, ſaid allſo, Doe not kill.</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, Rebellion, or but contempt of Gods commands, is ſeen in one ſin as well as in another. And though all ſtains or ſpots upon the Face or Clothes be not of, the ſame colour, yet as they are ſtains and defilements, are they to be equally cleanſed. And it is all a caſe, whether a man be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Knife, or a Sword; or bruiſed with a blunter Weapon, to his no leſſe danger. All Vertues are linked together in prudence, faith the morall Philoſopher; for as much as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prudence, men muſt needs offend, even in doing good things: And all ſins are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59605:84"/> and grounded upon folly, even thoſe which carrie along with them a pretenſe and ſhew of witt and cunning; all ſin being errour and all errour proceeding from ignorance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or involuntarie: And all ſins being managed by diſobedience againſt God, a man cannot heartily and ſincerely apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to obey God in any one point, unleſſe he beareth about him a diſpoſition to fulfill the will of God in all things commanded by God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And this Rule extendeth it ſelfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to our dutie towards our Neighbour; whome having ſeen and not having ſeen God, if we love not, we deceive our ſelves, as St. <hi>John</hi> teacheth us, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4. 20. He that uſeth deſpitefully the Image of his Prince, ſheweth his malice againſt his Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And no cheating or violence doth a man, out of covetouſneſſe and deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, offer to his Brother, but, for ſhame, or fear, or inability, he would uſe to his Father allſo, yea to God himſelfe. This doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by profane, blaſphemous, and outragious ſpeeches often uſed againſt his God, as the malice of a bitter ſpirit and tongue; when the hands cannot reach him. For I cannot but think that a man covetouſly bent to any great degree, would, if it were poſſible, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen God of what he hath, as well as his Neighbour, and tear from him by violence
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59605:84"/> what may ſerve his turne, as he ſticketh not to doe from his poor and weak Brother, when he is in the power of his hands. But no man is made innocent from impotencie of offending: And no man acquieſcing in any one fault or Vice unrepented of, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce himſelfe clean from any, or hope to obtain pardon for any one.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, as Repentance cleanſing us muſt extend to all manner of ſins, ſo that no man can deſerve the name of a true penitent who is angerly inclined, and not covetouſly; or luſtfully given, and not a Drunkard; or Proud, and not unjuſt; or a zealous cenſurer of profaneneſſe, and deboiſtneſſe, and yet world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or contumacious againſt Juſt Autority; ſo muſt the ſame repentance be generall as to time allſo; that is, perpetuall. A man muſt never have any kinde thought of that ſin whereof he pretends to have repented. He muſt have a perpetuall diſpleaſure againſt himſelfe for having ſo offended; he muſt have an immortall enmitie againſt it; And though perhaps he be not actually warring againſt it by open violence uſed againſt himſelfe for it, and againſt it, for his own ſake, he muſt never hang up his Armes ſo as never more to purſue it, as occaſion ſhall require. We are to imitate upon our ſelves, Gods Juſtice againſt ſin, which never ceaſes, where par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don doth not prevent it. God puniſhes the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59605:85"/> impenitent Sinner with everlaſting torments; and therefore man ſhould ſo judge himſelfe that he be not condemned of the Lord, And therefore, though a man ought not allwayes to be in teares, penances, and lamentations for ſins paſſed, yet allwayes muſt he bear an habituall grudge againſt it, an ill will, and enmifie: which intermitted by ſutable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for ſeaſons extraordinary, upon freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes of the ſame into his minde and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, he muſt exerciſe freſh acts of deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and humiliation for ſuch his failings and miſcarriages. Some men have ceaſed from the ſin they have been formerly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with; but upon occaſion can with ſome degree of content relate the ſame, amongſt them who will make merrie with it: Such, we may be ſure, are not cleanſed throughly from that ſin, though they have laid it aſide, and that ſo, that they never committ it over again. For were their ſoules but ſo much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged from it as they ought, as they never committed ſuch a ſin but with pleaſure (ſuch as it may be) ſo they ſhould never think of it but with diſpleaſure and deteſtation; and with an hidden ſmiting of the breſt with the Publican, ſay, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59605:85"/>
                  <p n="6">6. This, I ſay, ought to be done in ſome degree, occaſionally, though not in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeſt; as when at the time of illumination and converſion the ſoule repenting travaileth under the weight and ſenſe of ſin: eſpecially by them who are not by office, occupation, profeſſion wholly ſequeſtred from the world. For Monaſticall and Heremeticall lives are deſcribed to be nothing elſe but a ſtate of repentance; Repentance being ſo called from that which is moſt eminent in that ſtate, Faſtings, hardſhips, watchings, ſolitarineſſe, but when the worſhip of God requires com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with others.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But the degree required of all is not inconſiſtent with the due Alternations and viciſſitudes of Conſolations and ſpirituall Cheerfulneſſe before God and others. For upon repentance preſcribed and ſincerely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, it pleaſeth God in Scripture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelfe reconciled to the broken ſpirit: ſo that when God is ſaid to repent of the evill ſuffered by others for their offences, the offender may be ſure, to his great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that his repentance is accepted. As when upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his interceſſion in behalfe of the Idolatrizing <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 14. <hi>The Lord repented of the evill which he thought to doe unto his people.</hi> And <hi>Judges</hi> 2. <hi>It repented the Lord becauſe of the groanings of his people.</hi> Therefore in the like caſes, he

Too much lightneſſe, and jollity, and vanity having tranſported a man into evill before, tranſportation towards God well becometh the true Convert. <hi>David</hi> may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and a Rule to us in this kinde.

And no doubt but he adminiſter'd the Nation under him with

For no ſin connived at, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſuffered to abide with us, can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called a ſin of Infirmitie, but comes under the notion and nature of preſumptuous ſin: For as much as God the all ſeeing Judge, doth principally look upon the temper and diſpoſition of the will, and heart: according

                  <p n="1">1, NO doubt but all things that God made, as he made them, were at firſt good, and ſo continue: but all things continue not in that firſt and perfect ſtate, wherein they were, as well depending on God in their doing, as in their being. God gave man the moſt excellent gift of Reaſon; and under that, Appetites and affections, which are the inward motions of the Soule either to, or from God. So long as we walk by his light, we cannot erre in knowledge: ſo long as we deſire by his Will, we cannot erre in deſiring. Subordination to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream is no bondage; and confinement to him that is infinite, is no loſſe of libertie or freedome. 'Tis ignorance therefore which impells men no illimited knowledge: and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59605:87"/> ſervitude, to ſtudy and endeavour to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and commanders of our ſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. 'Tis not to know, that God prohibits; but to know without true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo flattly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting, and confuting mens opinion vainly conceived of themſelves, thus writing, 1 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>If any man thinke that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</hi> Which is moſt true, when he would needs know as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did, without God, or what God would have hidden and concealed from him: And when a man would needs know all things, but can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not to know himſelfe. For as Charity (of which the Apoſtle there allſo ſpeakes) according to the common, and generally true ſaying, begins at home; ſo doth, or ought to doe, knowledge: For the <hi>Alpha</hi> of true knowledge, and the <hi>Omega</hi> too is to know God; but a man cannot know God as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh him, when he ſtands in his own light. And in his own light may he be ſaid to ſtand, when he underſtands not himſelfe, his meaſures, his capacitie, and meanes to true knowledge. He that layeth hold of more than he can well ſpan, or embraceth more than his Armes can contain, commonly let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all goe, and loſeth it. And ſo it is in curioſity of knowledge; he knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that would pretend to all things.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59605:88"/> Like to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Revel. 3. 17. which becauſe ſhe gloried in her riches, <hi>was poor and wretched, and blinde, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and knew it not.</hi> What blindeneſſe, what ignorance ſo groſſe, lamentable, and dangerous as this? And yet loth are men to have their eyes opened to perceive it, as if in the miſt of their minde, they diſcerned and feared that which he who was cured of a phrenzie bewailed in himſelfe, that in his diſtemper he was much more happie, than in his cure. For in that he imagined and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe with nothing leſſe than a fair Principalitye under him, ſubjects obſequious, Pallaces ſtately, with Crown and Scepter: but reduced to his true reaſon, found the contrary to all theſe, to his great loſſe and trouble. And to ſuch exceſſes doth our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous knowledge betray us. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> before ſaith, <hi>Knowledge puffeth up:</hi> ſwells and apoſtemateth the Soule with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which often breakes out into rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe ſcandalous. Hence it is, that if a man erres wilfully and notoriouſly to all, he is not aſhamed; as <hi>Seneca</hi> obſerveth: as when in Grammar he ſpeakes falſe <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or gives a falſe pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a word: but if he doth it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, and be told of it, then he either bluſhes, or boldly defends his errour againſt his own tacit perſwaſion, leaſt he ſhould ſeem
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59605:88"/> not to have known as much as another: And <hi>Cardane</hi> (himſelfe a Phyſican) tells us, he knew one of the ſame facultie, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through ignorance, deſtroyed his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, rather than he would be thought ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, profeſſed he killed him on purpoſe, though there was no ſuch matter: to ſuch a monſtrouſneſſe of abſurdities, and iniquitie doth this unbridled and untamed humour of ſeeming wiſe, and appearing ſo, tranſport a man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This evill Appetite wars againſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as Religion, and is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with nothing more; and therefore ſhould Religion war againſt that; turning the forces of the Spirit againſt this Tower of the Fleſh built up to this dangerous height, by the evill ſpirit of Pride and affectation of vain-glorie. And this I look on as a prime and materiall part of our ſelfe-deniall, when we ſhall be able and willing to ſubmitte our private, buſie, and clambering Reaſon to the ſimplicitie of the Faith; and know our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and failings, as well as we know others; yea and better too; having attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that perfection which the wiſe Man only owned in himſelfe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 2. <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh than any man, I have not the underſtanding of a man:</hi> with this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation notwithſtanding, that if God, or good Autoritie under him ſhall have choſen any
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59605:89"/> ſuch humble Perſon to preſide, teach, and lead others, no modeſtie nor humility in him ought to with-hold him from diſcharging his office. No more than any knowing himſelfe more wiſe, or learned, out of his abundance, is to withdraw himſelfe from the guidance of ſuch an one, as he excells; under ſuſpicion of calling Gods Providence and Right in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to rule and teach by whome he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and eſpecially the difficult leſſon of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſelfe deniall. Don't I know? Can you teach me? is the language of a proud Spirit, very often; and of one who wilfully, how ignorantly ſoever, muſt and will have his ſaying. A man out of common charitie, might bluſh for ſuch as doe not bluſh, to hear them, oftentimes indeed wiſe and more than vulgarly knowing; when they fall into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, when they ſtumble in plain ground; when their miſtake happens by ſurpriſe or other incogitancie, how loth are they to be taken in the ſnares of truth it ſelfe? how they, by all tricks, pretences, fetches and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable devices and defenſes, would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie what once they happen to ſay, though conſcious to themſelves of errour, they would not have ſaid or done ſuch things, yet they once paſſing from them, they will maintain them to the laſt; though the more they ſtruggle, the more they are enſnared, and fall into a far worſe abſurdity in defending,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59605:89"/> than committing an errour. And all this that they might not ſuffer in their beloved and ſelfe-admired witt. And becauſe they cannot denie them, neither for Gods ſake, nor for trueths ſake; but hold it the moſt honourable courſe to themſelves, to bend both to their ſaying, than to yield to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by ſuch Rules. And if their wits fail them in framing evaſions and ſhuffles which may juſtifie, in ſome degree, their ſlips; Paſſion and loud clamour ſhall ſupport their cauſe, and drown the noiſe of weake trueth: as the Idolatrous <hi>Jewes</hi> were wont in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing their Children to <hi>Molech</hi> in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> to uſe Fife, Trumpet, and Drum, that the voice of the maſſacred might not be heard, or pittie ſhewn to them, nor juſtice: <hi>O fooliſh Galatians</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.) <hi>Who hath bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you that ye ſhould not obey the trueth?</hi> Anſwer may be made, ſelfe love, ſelfe-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; which are ſuch, that a man can better endure a blow on the Pate, than on his Opinion. But St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, Chap. 3. 14. <hi>My brethren, Lye not againſt the trueth.</hi> a reaſon whereof may be, becauſe he that oppoſes an acknowledged trueth, though not very important, ſinneth, in ſome degree, againſt the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of trueth, and the teſtimonie of his own Conſcience; and to have his will in arguing or doing,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59605:90"/> grieveth the Spirit of trueth; trueth in all things being Sacred and Divine; which, when it poſſeſſeth the minde of a man, ſeaſonable and true is that advice of the Prophet <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk,</hi> Chap. 2. 29. <hi>The Lord is in his holy Temple, let all the earth keep keep ſilence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. And this Advice reacheth unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Branch of a Chriſtians Selfe-deniall, which conſiſts principally and more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the ſubjecting the will of man to the Will of God, as that did in the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the underſtanding to the Wiſdome of God. Oh how naturall? how ſweet? and allmoſt, how neceſſarie it is, for man to have his own will? And yet in truth, how monſtrous is this unruly appetite? It ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from a root worſe than ordinarie Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie: as much as to make ones ſelfe a God, is a much more heinous ſin than to worſhip any other falſe God. And what is that (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we mean it, or not mean it) that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells men ſo paſſionately to deſire, and ſo violently to contend for their will, and as much of it as is poſſible, but that they would be great thereby; they would be ſupreame; they would rule and govern, not ſo much themſelves (for they are the worſt at that of all men) but others, and becauſe they would be admired and worſhipped; and that more, and in an higher degree than they dare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59605:90"/> own. When men have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to this miſleading and miſchievous temper, they would have no bounds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed them. God himſelfe ſhall not eſcape their murmures, if open accuſation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations: Every thing is uneaſie to them, that is not projected by their own witts, and managed by their wills. And whereas, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. <hi>Charitie,</hi> (that Divine grace made up of meekneſſe, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, love of God, and that which in any manner reſembles God) <hi>beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things,</hi> the Idolizer of his own will, (on the contrary) can bear nothing, believe nothing, hope nothing, endure nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting this his humour.

Whereas there is nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a wiſe man, and nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with a good Chriſtian, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have more wills under him than his own: for in trueth, he never is maſter of his own will, who would tyrannize over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For this may be but one ſin in forme and appearance, but it is the parent of many, if not of all, to ſtrive to have our wills.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. For what is Pride but an appetite of our unmortified wills, puſhing us forward to be great, Ruling, admired, followed, not to be led by any? What is Anger, but a deſire of ſatiating our luſt of revenge? What is Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, but to have all, and part with nothing but what Juſtice and Neceſſity extorts? And what is Luſt properly ſo called, but a furious will of carnall pleaſure? He therefore that will ever obtain any command of himſelfe in any of theſe things, or the like, muſt lay the Ax of Reformation to the root of all theſe trees, the generall luſting after a mans own will, and the ſatisfaction thereof naturally incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For though there may ſeem ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance outwardly between one ſin and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that there ſhould be no conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie between them, yet, in the practice, they, like perſons at domeſtick difference or civill diſſenſions, will joyn againſt a common and forrein Enemie; and help one another; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the obſervation of that mortified Father mentioned in Eccleſiaſticall Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: who deliver'd it for a trueth, That a man can never obſerve the rule of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, unleſſe he ſubdues the Luſt of Anger. For ſurely if we ſhall give leave to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt wills to take their ſwing in one thing; they will take leave to excurre into other evills, againſt our more adviſed judgements and wills. Therefore let us a little inſiſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59605:91"/> upon the reaſonableneſſe of ſuch affectation of our carnall wills.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But firſt it is to be obſerved, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelfe is not of that moroſity, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tyrannie, under colour of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it ſhould denie us the libertie wholly of that naturall facultie of deſiring and loving; for that God himſelfe hath placed in us: For then we could not love God himſelfe, nor chooſe the good or refuſe the evill, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe commandeth. It is not the rooting up of that Vine which Gods own hand hath planted in the heart of man, but the prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dreſſing it to bear generous bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and bunches. It is to cut off thoſe Suckers; to deſtroy that Nature which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch, and not made ſo by God. It is, according to the ancient Philoſophie, for our earthie Spheare, and inferiour and ſmaller Orb, to be ordered by the <hi>firſt mover</hi> of all; and to ſay, and to pray as Chriſt hath taught, <hi>Thy will he done in earth as it is in heaven:</hi> to live in this world as Chriſt came into it, and lived and died in it. As appeares by the hiſtorie of his holy and humble Life, which tells us, <hi>John</hi> 18. 37. <hi>To this end was I borne, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſſe unto the trueth: every one that is of the trueth hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my voice.</hi> And this was the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell he taught, and left us. And his bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59605:92"/> witneſs was to make himſelfe of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: as great, and as good as he was: to be obedient unto the death, even the death of the Croſſe; and to appear, as it were, without a will of his own: or, which is a greater victory and glory, to have a will allwayes obſequiouſly included in the Will of his heavenly Father; as it was, when, in great Agonies and conflicts of Soule he prayed to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 42. <hi>Nevertheleſſe not my will but thy will be done:</hi> demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what he before affirmed for a trueth, <hi>John</hi> 5. 30. <hi>I can of my ſelfe doe nothing, as I hear I judge: and my judgement is juſt: becauſe I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which is in heaven.</hi> And as the Diſciples ſaid, moſt loth to hazard ſo precious a Veſſell of honour, and ſervice, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> amongſt <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Barbarity, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 14. <hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi> And what better or wiſer reſolution can any good Chriſtian take, than what he ſaw Chriſt to practice before him; and the moſt Heroicall Chriſtians did, to have no will ſtirring but the Will of God and Chriſt? For this is to be what St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth to. <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 6. 11. <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye allſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be directed by the Wiſdome, and acted by the pleaſure of God alone: So that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59605:92"/> we may ſay as that good old Father in his Cell, having relinquiſhed the world; who when one came to him, and brought him the tidings, that a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

And this I intended for one diſtinct argument to denie our own wills, either wholly impeding the Will of God to be done in us, or the perfecter conformity to that, and the Example Chriſt hath ſet us.</p>

Secondly, The ſpeciall care that God taketh of him who careth leaſt for his own will, but committeth the management of it into the hands of his moſt Wiſe and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Father. 'Tis true, To have ones own will, and to doe as we are impelled by it, is the preciouſeſt Pearle in the world to the naturall man; nothing ſo deare to him as that; and that when it is really evill in it ſelfe, and hurtfull, though pleaſing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: But man having ſo little skill how to uſe ſuch a dangerous inſtrument, were it not much better to reſigne it into the hands of him that careth for us more than we doe for our ſelves, and is wiſer for us than we for our ſelves? As we ſee it in Children.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59605:93"/> When a thing of great value is beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by ſome Friend, the Parents have the keeping of it, leaſt it ſhould be loſt, ſpoiled, imbezel'd, or hurt the young ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; till he comes to yeers of diſcretion: So our Godfather properly ſo called, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, beſtoweth upon us that great Jewell of Freewill, and Choice, which he denies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Creatures, but with this tacit condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we ſhould committe it to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie, and by his wiſdome and direction only uſe and exerciſe the ſame, till we come to yeers of true diſcretion, which is only in Heaven, and not in this life. Then ſhall we have the full and abſolute uſe of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then there is no feare that we ſhould uſe it amiſſe, as here we doe. And this is that which holy <hi>David</hi> adviſeth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55. 22. ſaying, <hi>Caſt thy burden upon the Lord and he ſhall ſuſtain thee, he ſhall never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the righteous to be moved.</hi> This is it which St. <hi>Peter</hi> allſo exhorteth unto, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 5. 6, 7. <hi>Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; Caſting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</hi> And more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely and particularly, Chriſt himſelfe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth thus his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>Take no thought for your life, &amp;c. For, Which of you by taking care, can adde on cubit to his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> The trueth is, no man exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59605:93"/> ſo highly, as he who, ſecluding or not conſidering God, followes the will of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and the greateſt of all humiliation is by the ſubjecting of our wills to Gods, and the next and readieſt way to true preferrement, or exaltation. And <hi>take no thought,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) not commending ſupineneſſe, ſloth, or lazineſſe in any; but none without God, none not directed and regulated by his Will and Preſcripts: none, without conſulting him, and ſubmitting the event with all confidence aed calmeneſſe, to his all-diſpoſing, moſt wiſe, moſt juſt, moſt gracious Providence: and in ſuffering as well as doing his Will: For it is a Maxime or Rule berter becoming a Heathens mouth than a Chriſtians. Every man is maſter, or maker of his own fortune: not but that every man hath a hand in, and contributes towards Good or evill events be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling him, but that the Architectonicall, or Over-ruling Power of all is in God, whoe doth not allwayes give the Battle to the ſtrong, nor the Race to the ſwiſt, nor bread to the wiſe; to teach us that he is Lord paramount of all: according to the Divine acknowledgement of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 26. 12. <hi>Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us, for thou allſo haſt wrought all our works in us.</hi> And therefore it ſeems to me a thing, as very memorable, ſo more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the mouth and practice of a Chriſtian,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59605:94"/> what is written of <hi>Muhamed Olbarſalanus,</hi> the Great Prince of <hi>Bagdet</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> a <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen;</hi> who being wounded to death in a Battle, which he fought; as he died, ſaid, <hi>I never before this once, fought, but firſt I deſired Gods bleſſing.</hi> I would all Chriſtians would doe ſo, and have ſo much confidence in God, in all matters, eſpecially of importance; that they would firſt implore Gods aid, and then depend on him for the ſucceſſe: which if it be favourable, he muſt be humbly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; if improſperous, in like manner, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; as the effect of Gods Divine and wiſe Providence requires.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thirdly, The Scripture both by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and Precepts directs us to this reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as well as religious reſignation of our wills unto Gods Will; when it ſets before our eyes the practice of earthly Parents and Children, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>We have had Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our Fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence, ſhall we not much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits and live? For they verily for a few dayes chaſtened us, after their own pleaſure: but he for our profit, that we might be patakers of his holineſſe.</hi> Fathers of our fleſh may take a cruell pleaſure, rather than intend any reall profit or benefit unto Children, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing them; but 'tis not to be imagined that God can tranſgreſſe the mean, or erre in the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59605:94"/> end of any Diſpenſation ſevere, or unpleaſant to us: therefore much rather ſhould we be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits, and live a more eaſie, ſafe and comfortable life here, than otherwiſe can be expected, and a moſt happie life hereafter, where all things be perfectly ſubject to the Father, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15. that he may be here allſo, as well as hereafter, <hi>All in All.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Fourthly, This Selfe-deniall is the true Holocauſt or abſolute Sacrifice we can give to God, and moſt acceptable, impoſed upon us as true Believers, according to Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. 1. ſaying, <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reaſonable ſervice: And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of the ſpirit of your minde, that ye may prove what is that good and perfect Will of God.</hi> Sacrifices came alive to Gods Houſe and Altar, but were not accepted, till they were ſlain: ſo it is with the ſpirituall or reaſonable Sacrifice of our ſelves eſpecially: our naturall wills ſo long as they live, cannot pleaſe God; but they muſt be crucified, as Chriſt was crucified for us. And as the ſame Apoſtle adviſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. we muſt <hi>reckon our ſelves dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto ſin, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Christ.</hi> He that is dead, ceaſeth from
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59605:95"/> willing, and ſo from ſinning. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth himſelfe and his will, is dead indeed unto ſin, and liveth by the life of the Son of Man; and is acted by the Will of God. And ſurely, if it be our Dutie, our Wiſdome, our Righteouſneſſe, to committ our very Soules and life into Gods hands and diſpoſall, ſhall we ſtick to render that one faculty of our Soule, our Wills, into his hands? That doth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> exhort us unto, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Wherefore let them who ſuffer according to the will of God, committ the keeping of their ſoules to him in well doing, as unto a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creatour.</hi> Let God then have the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Wills as he hath of our Lives: as he had of Chriſts humane Will: as he had of <hi>Davids</hi> Will; when <hi>Saul</hi> was in the power of his hands: when <hi>Shemei</hi> railed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and when at the word given, his head might have been taken off, and the King revenged of a Petulant ſlanderer; yet he committed his cauſe to God; and ſeeing, at ſome diſtance, his Hand and Will, humbly acquieſced.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Fifthly, Nature it ſelfe teaches us (and upon that <hi>Abimelech</hi> bowed the men of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems</hi> heart to make him King) to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to one rather than to many, there being no perſonall diſparity, which may alter the Caſe: how much more elegible then muſt it needs be, for a man well adviſed to ſubmitt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59605:95"/> to the Monarchie of God, than to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, or tyrannicall Democracie of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable luſts? whereof ſome vote one thing, and ſome another. One tugges us this way, and another draggs us that way; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many times inconſiſtencies and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and worreying and wearing out the ſimple Soule by unreaſonable ſollicitations and vexations. For moſt truely ſaid Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Know ye not that to whome ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whome ye obey; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſſe?</hi> Every irregular Affection, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very inordinate Luſt is a Tyrant, and would needs ſubject us to it: ſo miſerable is that Soule which liſtens or leans to them, being divided from God and it ſelfe. For prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, and covetouſneſſe; Anger, and deſire of Revenge; Envie, and Malice; Superſtition and profaneneſſe; Puſillanimitie and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Slothfulneſſe, and indefatigable drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the world; Loving ſtrange Faces, and embraces, Lothing lawfull, and laudable, exceſſive exaltation and exultation, when matters proceed, proſper, and ſucceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our looſe phanſies and fondneſſe, and dejection of minde and ſpirit, when we are worſted in our deſignes, and croſſed, and fruſtrated of our hopes and expectations. All theſe, and more than theſe never ceaſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſting
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59605:96"/> and diſquieting a man, untill they ſee him ſecured under the protection, and in the ſervice of Allmighty God, reſolving to obey him againſt all temptations, and to look on all occurrences as ſent chiefly to make proof of his obedience and patience. And that this free and full ſubmiſſion doe not only bring admirable quiet and tranquillity to the minde, but ſanctitie and puritie (the thing we at preſent purſue) appeares by the Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> Chap. 10. 9, 10. where, having propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an Example, and our imitation, the readie obedience of Chriſt, of whome it was ſaid, <hi>Lo, I come to doe thy will, O God:</hi> it followeth, <hi>By which will we are ſanctified.</hi> That is, by that readie conformation of our wills to the Will of God.</p>

Doe we not read in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. 14. of ſuch Perſons, who have eyes full of Adulterie, and cannot ceaſe from ſin? Not that the viſive facultie good in it ſelfe and a great gift of God, can of it ſelfe be ſubject to ſuch a crime; but that, through the communication and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the inward and outward Man, ſuch luſtings are either bred or ſtirred up by ſuch Aſpects. The Jacks or Keis in the Virginall, Harpſicon or Organ being touched with the Finger, doe not ſound themſelves,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59605:97"/> but they ſtrike the inward ſtrings, which render the ſound: So when the outward Senſes themſelves are ſtruck by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular objects, they ſoon communicate that paſſion ſcarce felt by them, to the inward Senſes, which make all the noiſe. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> delivers this as a trueth experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in himſelfe (<hi>Confeſſ.</hi> Lib. 7. 1.) when he ſaid, <hi>After what outward formes my minde wandered, the ſame Images did my heart run after allſo.</hi> So that even the ſubtiller Heathens could not but ſee the coherence between Phanſie, and Senſes, and between the Appetites of the Soule and them both, when they tell us, By our Eyes we are Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; by our Eyes we are hurried into all manner of Vices; by our Eyes we are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, by our Eyes we look on the Wine, when it ſhewes it ſelfe in the Glaſſe: our eyes are caſt upon the Riches of the world, as <hi>Achan</hi>'s upon the wedge of Gold, and the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Garment, and by orderly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie, but allmoſt neceſſarie gradations and conſequences, we, as he, are led to ſee, to covet, to take them. That ſubtile Serpent the Devill knew too well what power the temptations had entring into a man through the eye; when by his artifice he preſented to Chriſt all the glories of the world, and with ſuch a ſuddain ſurpriſe that ſcarce any but Chriſt could have withſtood or reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59605:97"/> them. <hi>Job</hi> therefore would not ſo much as caſt a vain and idle glance upon a beautie which might delude him, <hi>Job.</hi> 31. having no occaſion juſtly ſo to doe: knowing aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the conjunction of the minde with an unlawfull object, without that bodilie conjunction, adulterates the Soule: And ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with reſolution and ſtrong inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does that before God, which men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cenſure, and ſo according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the object, is the pollution diverſifyed allſo. So that if there be (as naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers tell us, <hi>Coel. Rhodigin</hi>) an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Diſeaſes of the naturall Eye: the morall diſtempers by ill uſe of them, may be accounted many more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And if I ſhould give ſome inſtances of the many waies of corrupting the ſight, the reſt may more readily be made up by mens own obſervations. Poring upon Faces pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to catch fonder Spectatours: Taking pleaſure in beholding wanton Pictures, under pretence, it may be, that it is but a dead object; or that fowl things are finely drawn. Viewing wanton poſtures and geſtures, by either Sex, or of either Sex. Yea caſting an eye upon the mutuall and naturall actions of Animalls doing according to their kinde, a man would think it ſhould put one to the bluſh, but too often the contrarie is found by a ſympathie to be abhorred, which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59605:98"/> the Maſters of Jewiſh morality noted; and wiſely diſſwaded all to turne their Faces from. Amorous Romances, and Laſcivious Poetrye are to be reduced to this caution. And that eye cannot be accounted innocent which, coming into a Shop of Rarities and great varieties, looketh not ſo much, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth what it doth want, but ſeeketh for ſomewhat; which when it beginneth firſt to ſee, it beginneth allſo to want and deſire: and to want it becauſe it deſireth it; and not deſire it becauſe it wanteth it. Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent therefore is that counſell of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> Chap. 9. v. 5. 7. againſt both theſe, and their fellowes, and that when there were no Monks, nor Friers in the world, upon whome we would caſt ſuch ſevere counſells as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion leads them to: <hi>Gaze not on a Maid that thou fall not by thoſe things that are precious in her. Look not round about thee, in the ſtreets of the City, neither wander thou in the ſolitarie places thereof.</hi> But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Evangelicall counſell exceeds this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out. It is better for thee to,</hi> &amp;c. Nature (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> obſerves) to preſerve the eye (a very tender and precious part) hath fenced it with hairs on the lids, as ſo many Speares; which, at the approach of the leaſt Enemy to it, being but lightly touched, give notice to ſhut it preſently, for its ſecuritye. But
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59605:98"/> it hath not provided ſuch meanes to defend the eye from morall objects which are ever in readineſſe to offend it: but that is the ſpeciall gift of God, and ſhould be the Chriſtian prudence of every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And the like circumſpection is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be had about the Ear, another moſt profitable, yea neceſſarie Senſe, and no leſſe paſſionate than the other: 'Tis incredible even to them that are overcome and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by diſhoneſt Speeches, lewd Books, obſcene Poetry, what a change, and that for the worſt, aptly tempered ſounds and melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Voices have upon a man. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him and make him moody, and heavie; they inflame and lighten him, make him brisk and wanton, make him full of talk, and ridiculous motions; and finally, inſnare and draw him to humour the notes in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, good or bad. <hi>Ceaſe my Son</hi> (therefore ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>to hear the inſtruction that cauſeth to erre from the words of knowledge:</hi> whether Poeticall, or Proſaicall. For when the forme of words, the eloquence of the Tongue, and gracefulneſſe of ſpeaking are the gift of God, the matter clothed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, and adapted to the eare by them, may be of the Devills deviſing; and ſent before him to fowl the room of the Soule, for him and his unclean Spirits to dwell there. For as
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59605:99"/> the Good Spirit of Wiſdome, will not enter into a body given to ſin, no more will, or can the evill Spirit enter into a Soule or bodie not fitted for his turne by impure co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations and devices. <hi>Turne therefore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Proverbs</hi> 14. 7.) <hi>from the preſence of a fooliſh man when thou perceiveſt not in him the lips of knowledge.</hi> Which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is there uſed for wiſe and profitable talke, oppoſed commonly to fooliſhneſſe: which in Scripture ſignifies, as much as Sin. And in ſo adviſing he doth implye the next and right way to avoid not only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſingle acts of corrupt communication, but even the inclination and deſire of impure matter imbibed by word or writing. For it is true in morall things as well as naturall, that the underſtanding is made all things, according to the impreſſion made by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as Philoſophers teach; being formable into any ſhape: So, according to divinity, is it true, that, according to the pure and chaſt ſubject we chooſe to meditate on, and converſe with, or the light, obſcene, and frothy, is the inward Senſe affected, not only actually or tranſiently; but habitually and permanently. So that in accuſtoming a mans ſelfe to immodeſt and immorall acts or buſineſſes, the minde is ſo tainted that all Diviner things become unſavourie and irkſome. In like manner, to the palate of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59605:99"/> the Soule accuſtomed to ſpirituall, pure, and chaſt Diſcourſes, and reading, the pleaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of vain, idle, and fooliſh Subjects, and eſpecially obſcene, becomes alltogether extinguiſhed; an irkſomeneſſe ſucceeding in its place.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And there being ſuch neer relation (as we have partly ſeen) between the Ear and the Tongue, as there is between a Fiddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and Fiddle, to ſtrike it as it pleaſeth: the ſame doctrine of Sanctitie reacheth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the due regiment of the one, as well as of the other; but more eſpeciall care and cuſtodie ſeem to be due to this, than that. For as much as the Tongue is an active part and Organ to evill, but the Ear, paſſive chiefly. And ſometimes it ſo falls out, that a man muſt, whether he will or no, hear what is leud, vain, riotous, wanton, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and prophane; but no man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to uſe his Tongue ſo indiſcreetly and wickedly: he hath it more in his power, than he hath his Eares; and therefore he is the more obliged to make a good uſe of the one than he can of the other. And as ſome have obſerved, Nature by fencing it double with Teeth and Lips, leaſt it ſhould treſpaſſe upon God and our Neighbours, teaches us with what good advice and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration we are to uſe it. For in trueth, generally it ſo demeaneth it ſelfe, that few
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59605:100"/> can give that a good word, which is the great inſtrument of Speech: And ſeldome is it better employed than when it accuſes it ſelfe; and commends taciturnity and ſilence. What can be ſaid of it, or any thing elſe more bitterly or truely, than what St. <hi>James</hi> writeth of it, Chap. 3. <hi>The Tongue is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly evill; full of deadly Poiſon. Therewith bleſſe we God even the Father, and therewith curſe we men, which are made after the Image of God.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. <hi>Death and Life are in the power of the Tongue:</hi> meaning, that by a Lying, ſlandering, perjurious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and unclean Tongue, we haſten Death to others, ſo that our own damnation at the ſame time, lingreth not thereby; Chriſt telling us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36, 38. that, <hi>For every evill word that men ſpeak, they ſhall give an account at the day of judgement. For, By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> So that the Tongue or ſting of the Adder is not ſo poiſonous and pernicious as the evill tongue of Man. For that doth not ſting or hurt the uſer; but this doth: verifying what is ſaid of wicked men, <hi>Pſſalm</hi> 6. 4, 8. <hi>They ſhall make their own tongues to fall on themſelves: All that ſee them ſhall flee away,</hi> viz. as from the face and ſting of a Viper. And if we would judge of the ill Tongue, as we doe of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of worth, from their Extraction, we ſhall
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59605:100"/> find how low and baſe an originall it hath, from St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>The Tongue is a little member, boaſting great things: the Tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: it defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the whole body, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and is ſet on fire of Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſee here what purgation the Tongue needeth, which is ſo foul that it defileth the whole body naturall, and diſordereth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Towns, and whole Countries; yea Nature it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To inſiſt upon the particular <hi>Vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> uſed by the Tongue, to execute its miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, would be to launch out too far into an ocean of matter: but it may ſuffice to point at the principall Vices and pollutions, to be carefully avoided and wiped off: ſuch as murmuring againſt God, and our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, upon every light occaſion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe things are carried on in the Publick otherwiſe than our private wiſdome can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; we not being of the Counſell of State, nor our approbation deſired. Upon which followes ſcoffing, belying, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our Superiours, and thereby ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on fire the courſe of Nature, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king publick combuſtions and confuſions. <hi>Beware therefore</hi> (ſaith the wiſe Man) <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> 1. <hi>of murmuring which is unprofitable, and refrain your tongue from backbiting. For there is no word ſo ſecret that ſhall goe for

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. And when bare Lying will not effect what we intend, it taketh unto its ayd, Swearing, and Curſing, and blaſphemous Speeches againſt Heaven it ſelfe: provoking that to revenge the injurie done to God and man thereby. Of which many inſtances might be produced, but that only ſhall I give which <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> Lib. 7. in the yeer of our Lord 1701. gives of one <hi>Simon de Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> who raſhly boaſting in the Schools, that he underſtood thorowly the Law of Chriſt, and could make it nothing in confuting it, became ſuddainly ſo ignorant of all learning, that he could not ſo much as ſay the Lords Prayer over, nor read the Alphabet. And late yeers have produced ſuch preſumptuous and virulent Tongues againſt the Holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God ſetled amongſt us, glorying in the mean time of their own abilities and gifts, that as they at firſt wilfully rejected the Lords Prayer, ſo have they at leugth, been unable to rehearſe it, themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging why they did not uſe it, leaſt they ſhould be out, in ſaying it; though they wanted not other reaſons, which ſomtimes they were aſhamed to render for the diſuſe of it. And in trueth, I am much aſhamed of the little ſeverity taken againſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of our Religion; when I reade in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59605:101"/> of a late Authour in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> that, When any amongſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> or <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Affrica,</hi> commits Sacriledge, or doth any action to the diſhonour of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or the Religion profeſſed in that place, they pour ſcalding Lead into his Mouth, which ſinks in with an horrible ſmoak. But with us, alas! ſuch remiſſeneſſe againſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of our Religion is in faſhion, that it is allmoſt become one of the priviledges of the greater ſort, and part of the libertie of the Subject amongſt the inferiour, to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Religion; and if the Protectours of the Church and Religion ſhall venture to be ſharp upon ſuch, they have in readineſſe a reſerve of evill language to wound their Judges and Perſecutour by, calling them proud, buſie, domineering Prelates: and ſo the guilt is of a ſudden, transferred from them, unto the puniſhers of it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. To theſe may be allſo added, the ſoothing, hypocriticall, and flattering Tongue, which while it coxeth, and ſtroketh, and tickleth, ſorely woundeth. Surely God will not ſhew himſelfe ſo plauſible to ſuch a Tongue, if we believe the Pſalmiſt, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall be done unto thee thou falſe Tongue: ſharp arrowes of the Allmighty, with coals of Juniper,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 12. 3. And Pſalm 12. 23. <hi>They ſpeake vanity every one with his Neighbour, with flattering lips and with a

For as no Perſon is more formidable than the wild Beaſt, the Railer and open Reviler, which with the teeth of his Tongue, teareth the Name and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him he ſeizeth on; and ſo, as the Bee ſtingeth with that violence that it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it ſelfe thereby; in like manner, nothing is more ridiculous or odious than that tame Beaſt which licketh with its Tongue, till it poiſons the party; himſelfe in the mean time periſhing in the eſteem and value of all men. A guard therefore of the Tongue is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, both to ſecure the Speaker and Hearer.

If a notion comes into his head, like a vain Prodigall, though he be in want him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he will ſpend that, and all that he hath upon others; who, as it happens to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kinde of Spend-thrifts, when he has done, will laugh at him for his pains and liberality: St. <hi>Peters</hi> advice is this, <hi>If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi> Oracles were given of Divine, or very weighty matters. And in very few words; and them very true. If a man therefore, (obſerving this rule) would ſpeak, 1. With deliberation. 2. With brevity. 3. About matters of conſequence. 4. Rarely. 5. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably only, he ſhould prevent great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs to himſelfe, and conduce much to the good of others. And before a man can be truely maſter of his Mouth, ſo far as not to ſpeak what he ſhould not; it will be needfull that he get ſuch a victory over himſelfe, as ſometimes not to ſpeak when cauſe is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59605:103"/> or occaſion rather. For he that ſaith, (<hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 4. 23.) <hi>Refrain not to ſpeak when there is occaſion to doe good, and hide not thy wiſdome in her beauty;</hi> ſaith allſo, Chap. 32. 7. <hi>Speak young man if there be need of thee; and yet ſcarcely, when thou art twice asked.</hi> According to circumſtances of Perſons, Aged, or Young; Strangers, or Acquaintance; of matter, underſtood, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; within our Sphere, or out of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; of time and of place, are words to be uſed: Leſt talking inordinately becomes a Diſeaſe; and intemperance of ſpeaking, (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> calls <hi>Garulitie</hi>) be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a flux of the Mouth, and not eloquence; folly, and not prudence; ignorance, and not knowledge: according to the acute replye of <hi>Demaratus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> (<hi>Apotheg. Lacon.</hi>) unto one demanding of him being ſilent, when others talked, Doe you ſay nothing out of doubting, or ignorance? This latter cannot be, ſaid he, for a Fool cannot hold his Tongue.

For as the Spirits and naturall faculties of man are the cauſe of motion and actions, ſo are they maintained and cheriſhed by outward acts and exerciſes. But if a man ſhall pretend (as is before intimated) that it ſuffices that a mans life is entire; his Underſtanding ſound and good, his Will free and brisk, his Affections vigorous and powerfull; and, theſe things ſtanding ſo, it is ſuperfluous to take any pains about the outward parts; it
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59605:104"/> were to rob God of his due; and, in time, himſelfe of that preſumed Perfection of his heart and minde. For undoubtedly there is a naturall communication and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence held between the outward and inward man, the Spirit, and the Fleſh; the outward actions and inward affections: and that they mutually aſſiſt or weaken one another, is apparent to reaſon, and experience.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59605:104"/> the preſcriptions of our lawfull Governours, endeavouring and deſigning to regulate the outward man anſwerable to the habit which beſt becometh the inward; in ſimplicity, in abſtinence, in gravitie, in humility, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to anholy profeſſion, and poſſeſſion taken of the Soule by Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For it is undoubtedly a very falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of common prudence or vertue, (and much more of Religion) to imagine a man cannot offend both God and his Brother, by the ſcandalouſneſſe of moroſe or affected ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, provided his heart be upright to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: which yet can ſcarce be ſuppoſed. For unleſſe ſome perverſe opinion or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition firſt ſeizes ſuch Spirits, it is hard to believe they ſhould affect a diſconformity to the Rules and Practice eſtabliſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the promoting of decencie and Pietye.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But next to the deteſtable humour of oppoſing things becauſe they are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the unreaſonable oppoſition they make to preſcribed ſeverities, and teſtimonies of holding unity with the Churches of all Ages and places, by undervaluing that little that remains amongſt us of auncienter, and ſtricter obſervations. They, for inſtance, will tell you, that Faſting is abſtinence from all Meats, and Drinks, for the time deſigned; and not to admitt of, or tolerate, a diſtinction
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59605:105"/> of Meats; and becauſe ſome exceptions muſt, according to the charity of the Church, as well as wiſdome and goodneſſe of States, be made from all Rules and preſcriptions of men, and ſometimes the generall order given by God, (as appears by the argument of Chriſt taken from <hi>Davids</hi> practice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 3. in eating the Shew-bread; againſt the hypocriticall and preciſe <hi>Phariſees</hi>) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre from ſuch Diſpenſations, the abſurditie of the Rule, with greater abſurditie; and ſcoffe, and laugh, as if they were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and much more perfect Chaſtiſers of their Bodies or deniers of their Senſes, than the low rate prohibitions are ſet at, by the Church. The Church, to be ſure, meanes and deſignes much greater things than it indiſpenſably requires; and that while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations are but too eaſily obtained. And ſuch glorious aſſerters of ſuch great things, ſhould doe very well to exceed vulgar pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices: but while they ſpeak contemptibly of the Day of ſmall things, themſelves, in the mean time ſometimes alledging the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſſe, and ſometimes the lightneſſe of the burden laid on them, will doe juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that kinde, they and their laughter too, become ridiculous.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. But what ſhall we ſay of ſuch late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſputants as the Chriſtian world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of, or if heard of, lothed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned? who ſtick not to make the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed freedome of eating and drinking, as Nature moves them, a part of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie which Chriſt purchaſed with his blood, and whereby he made us free; and in which we muſt ſtand faſt, as they miſtake the Apoſtle? As if Chriſt at the ſame time that he freed us from the Jewiſh reſtraints by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had alſo freed us from all Chriſtian Lawes; and proclaimed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting yeer of Jubilee, and liberty for the Naturall Law of mens Appetites to take place, without diſtinction of times, ſeaſons, or reaſons left undoubtedly in the power of Superiours to moderate. What is this but to make the Coming, and Goſpell of Chriſt to advance the brutiſh part of man to its perfection? upon which muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow the great imperfection of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. What is this but to interpret the Oracles of God, by the Oracles of the Belly ſuggeſting ſuch Scholies? Doe I ſpeak this that I can glorie in any gift in this kinde, above others? No ſurely, but rather bluſh at my defects herein: Only this I may ſay, that I retain ſuch a veneration for the uſe and ends of abſtinences and the univerſall practice of the Catholick Church, that I
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59605:106"/> abhorre the petulancie of ſuch, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, who teach otherwiſe: not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but they fall under that menace of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo to doe, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> And ſurely, denying our Senſes, was allwayes reputed a Command of Chriſt, in generall: which to apportion to every mans capacitie, belonged to his Miniſters. So that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Rule preſcribed by the Church concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, ought not ſecurely to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted and applied by every mans ſingle and private opinion that he hath of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie, or inſufficiencie to practiſe the ſame, but may better be committed to the judgement of others, and by them diſpenſed. For ſome are too rigorous to themſelves, and others, (the greater number) too partiall and indulgent; and therefore ſafer and more reaſonable it is, to denie our ſelves that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and dear Judicature which every man is fond of; and to committ our ſelves, and eſpecially our Senſes to the wiſdome of others not repugnant to greater Autority.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But that which is moſt of all to be avoided, is the intemperance and exceſſe which Art addeth to Nature: which is that we may call Luxurie, ſpecially to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd hereafter. Surely it is too much for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59605:106"/> a good Chriſtian, to be allwaies full within, and allwayes warme without, and allwayes at eaſe, and to fence our ſelves by all care and ſollicitude, againſt all ordinary incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, and inconveniences, ſo eſteemed by fleſh and blood: the Scripture pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them rather miſerable than happie, by the Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 1, <hi>Woe be to them that are at eaſe in Sion;</hi> i. e. under no hardſhip or moleſtation! rather drudging infinitely, to gratifie Back, Belly, Eyes, Eares, and Palate, with all Delectables; contemning the ſimple ſufficiencie and ſalubritie of Nature; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing Luſts of all ſorts, by inventions ſtrange and new, to a greater rampantneſſe than cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature it ſelfe diſpoſed to: Nay, to that exceſſe of Faſhion and Folly doe men ſtrive to arrive, that to attain praiſe and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or but eſtimation for their Vanities, they can ſuffer more pain, and run greater hazards of miſchiefing their Bodies, than they doe, who for Heaven ſake (I mean the ſtrait Gate of Auſterities leading thither) ſuffer willingly bodily incommodations: and by affected nakedneſſes of Back, Breſt, and Armes, ſhew themſelves more hardy for Fanſie and Faſhion-ſake, than the Plowman or Carter. If a man ſhould preſcribe this for Gods ſake, which is done ſo frequently for the Worlds ſake, he ſhould be judged very unreaſonable, if not ſuperſtitious allſo.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59605:107"/> And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minde:</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>As obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not faſhioning your ſelves according to your former luſts in your ignorance;</hi> Ignorance and not skill; cunning, and not Art being, according to him, the Parent of ſuperfluities and vanities worldly.

                  <p n="6">6.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59605:107"/> of plaiting the hair or of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparell, but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit; which is in the ſight of God, of great price.</hi> How doth this Doctrine of St. <hi>Peter</hi> croſſe and confound the Apologies of the Advocates of outward lightneſſe in Apparell and Behaviour? The Wiſdome, yea the Religion of this World argueth this, It matters not much what habit a Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man uſes, nor what faſhion they follow in outward Dreſſes and Ornaments, provided they have good hearts towards God; and be upright, and innocent, and true, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in the main Duties of Religion: But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> plainly ſaies, doe not that, but ſee to this. And whoſe ſenſe of Scripture is ſo narrow as to imagine that it intended none but Women here, and not effeminated Men? And who doth not ſee, that if it had ſufficed to regard the inward man only, and the heart of Chriſtians, that theſe wiſe and holy Apoſtles would never have urged the gravitie and ſobriety in wearing Hair, and uſing Apparell, and Gold, and Silver, thereby diſobliging wavering or green Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and by ſuch indifferent ſeverities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring them from ſubmitting to the uneaſie Goſpell of Chriſt? But more blameable are ſuch affected Artifices about the Bodie in men
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59605:108"/> of greater mindes and deſignes than Women: and moſt of all in Perſons devoted to holy functions and miniſtrations: ſome of whome we may ſuſpect to have a worſe end than the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in their religious Offices, <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſeen of men: and to covet rather to be ſeen and admired by Women, for the ſpruce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Habits: to the lothing of their improper affectations, by ſober Perſons, and contempt of their Character and capacitie ſpirituall: appearing to commend themſelves to mens Eyes rather than their Conſciences, which was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> choice and practice.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Nature and Infirmities are ſometimes juſtly alledged for the vindication of ſuch from lightneſſe in ſuch modiſhneſſe: which ſometimes may be true, and 'twere to be wiſhed were never otherwiſe: but that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Diſtempers require ſuch curiouſneſſe, as is upon ſuch pretences taken up, who can ſay? or that all ſuch ends could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied as well by artleſſe ſupplements. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would men betake themſelves to that wretched <hi>Topick</hi> for refuge, taken from the abſolute nature of things in themſelves no wayes ſinfull: and that there is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean in it ſelfe: whereas all ſuch things are to be judged by the circumſtances of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Sexes, Places, Offices, Age, Time, and ſuch like; all which to confound with ſuch an univerſall argument is abſurd enough to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59605:108"/> themſelves, at the firſt appearance. But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion heretofore never made Nature Judge in ſuch caſes as this, unleſſe in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſenſe, demanding, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>Doth not nature it ſelfe teach you, that if a man hath long hair, it is a ſhame unto him?</hi> And may not this be extended farther allſo, were it not that greatneſſe, ſtrength, and numbers concerned are in a readineſſe to oppreſſe ſuch Diſcourſes and the Authour of them. The times were, in my memorie, when the Puritanes preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed loudly for ſhort Hair; but whether they changed their Opinions and Notes when they perceived the Biſhops likewiſe required the ſame of their Clergie; or whether the Faction conquering and proſpering thought it time to lay that Faſhion down, and be the firſt of the Miniſtery, that I remember, to have made uſe of artificiall Hair, I will not determine. But this I may ſay, that they found not long after, followers in this way, who differed in other things from them: but hereupon began to be better reconciled to that injudicious, crude and dangerous Doctrine of worſhipping God ſo with the heart and Spirit, as no Cenſure ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for any outward indecencies, in the Miniſters or Worſhip of God, but what are common to all men.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. But with me, that is more wiſely and authentickly deliver'd, which I finde, <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus</hi> 19. 29, 30. <hi>A man may be known by his look; and one that hath underſtanding by his countenance, when thou meeteſt him.

Whereupon the wiſeſt of Chriſtians have ever preached up and preſcribed plainneſſe with cleanlineſſe of outward habits of all ſorts, as a notable correcter of inward vanity, and lightneſſe: as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher writes of Mares in their Venereall furie are tamed by ſhaving their Manes.<note place="margin">Plinius.</note> And if Men or Women ſhould ſhave off all that Art adds to them in the like kinde, I am of opinion, they would looſe a great part of their confidence, and wantonneſſe, and gain a neerer ſtep to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and Gods acceptance thereupon; as the Scripture plainly teaches us in the caſe of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> offending God highly, with whome God refuſed to treat of a reconciliation, untill they layd by their
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59605:109"/> gaudineſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 5. <hi>Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to doe to thee.</hi> And according to the Leviticall Law, there were ſeverall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in Garments, properly ſo called; and ſo certainly are there, in a ſenſe ſpirituall, when abuſed in ſuch ſort.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And this I ſpeak not ſo abſolutely, but with allowance for degrees, ranks, and orders of Men and Women, diſtinguiſhing them: but rather 'tis ſuch affectation of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, Faſhions, and Gallantrie I look on and condemn as is inconſiſtent with Sobriety, Wiſdome, and true Pietie, which bring in a confuſion of theſe, and a ſcandall to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and many times prove an introduction to groſſe impieties.</p>

BUT having thus ſpoken generally of the Dutie of Sanctification and Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Man; it will be requiſite, for greater plainneſſe, and eaſier progreſſe herein, to deſcend to ſome particular Sins, which every good Chriſtian is obliged to quitt himſelfe of, not only for their own
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59605:110"/> ſakes, but for the tail or train of ſins they draw after them. For we finde a common diſtinction of ſins into Mortall and Veniall; againſt which, or for which, I ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no Diſputation at preſent: only I ſhall preſume this as granted on all ſides: That all ſins are not equally ſinfull: and that ſome ſins are more prolificall and fruitfull than others; and that theſe, however in ſhew they appear not foul and ſcandalous, are indeed more dangerous and deadly than others; more deteſted in their conſequences. Such, for inſtance, are Pride, Covetouſneſſe, and Slothfullneſſe, and ſome others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither ſhall I here contend about the number of theſe Capitall Sins, in which I finde ſome difference among Authours, as allſo in the very kinds; but ſhall pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Seven, which I may firſt rank ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that diſtinction before given of Sins proper to Evill Spirits; and of Sins more proper to Beaſts: Of both which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and frail Man too much partakes. For Pride, Envie and Anger may ſeem to have the Devill for their proper Sire. And Covetouſneſſe, Gluttonie, Luxurie, and Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, are more brutiſh than the other: And both ſorts are ſo bad, that if a man were to chooſe, he could not tell which to be moſt aſhamed of: neither being at all deſireable, or cligible. Sometimes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59605:110"/> teaches us that Pride is the Originall of all ſin: and ſometimes that Covetouſneſſe is the Root of all evill: which are both true, if we conſider them thus ranged. For of all mentall ſins, wherein man draweth neereſt unto the Devill, who is a Spirit, Pride may be ſaid to be the Mother. And of all bodily ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as proceed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly from corrupt Fleſh and Blood, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe may be ſaid to be the root; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, eſpecially as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth; for a concupiſcence tending to the ſatiating the Sences, ever leaſt ſatisfied, where they are moſt cocker'd and indulged. But omitting curioſity and prolixitie, we ſhall conſider them in their order mentioned; giving a brief deſcription of theſe diſtempers of the Soule, and then of their Cures.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. PRIDE, (we know) was the firſt Sin committed, and the firſt ſpot that blemiſhed the fair Works of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of all things, and that one of the faireſt and nobleſt made by him. For as Angells were the top and Crown of Gods Creation, ſo was <hi>Lucifer</hi> the Head (as is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved)
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59605:111"/> of Angells, of his order eſpecially. And his ſin was Pride, and his Pride an emulation of God himſelfe, ſaying within himſelfe, I will aſcend and be like unto God. He thought himſelfe ſuch a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne Subject, that he ought to caſt all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty off him; and bring the reſt of the world to be governed by Ariſtocracie; in which he hoped for a principall place, and to have a negative Voice, at leaſt. But that Pride which infatuated his underſtanding to aſpire ſo high, weighed down his perſon to a baſe and monſtrous condition, both of ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and torment.

It being ſaid of God, that <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the proud, James</hi> 4. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. and this agreeing with what we read, <hi>Job</hi> 40. 11. as a property of God, <hi>viz.</hi> to caſt abroad the rage of his wrath, and to behold every one that is proud, and abaſe him. and as if the ſin of Pride were greater than the puniſhment of the guilty perſon could any waies anſwer, God declares he will <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the houſe of the proud, Proverbs</hi> 15. 25. Infinite other Texts of holy Scripture teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like vengeance ready to fall not only on the perſon, but familie of the proud:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59605:111"/> and that where the pride of the heart aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to an high and perpetuall name. For what can they expect from God more juſtly; than that they ſhould follow <hi>Lucifer</hi> in his fall, whome they have imitated in his ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exaltation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And what a piece of ſhort-wittedneſſe is that, for men not to be able to diſcerne, that by that very meanes, whereby they hope to be overvalued in the world, they are undervalued, hated, ſcorned, and curſed by men; ſo far as the greatneſſe, power and tyrannie of the proud doe not cruſh them into more conformity to their humour, than they are diſpoſed to of themſelves. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to the humble and lowly, love and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity impell men to aſcribe more than they claim.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And here it is well to be obſerved that Pride caſts it ſelfe into more formes, and acts more parts than one; ſo that it many times paſſeth undiſcovered. For there is a Mentall pride; when the outward deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may ſeem to be lowly and orderly: and there is a Corporall pride, conſiſting in outward oſtentations of words and phraſes affectedly lofty, and gloriouſneſſe of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, ſtrange phantaſtick, and above the Purſe, parts and rank of the wearer: This is in truth, ſet on foot by the high minde, but the high minde is augmented in its vanitie,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59605:112"/> by the lifted up Neck, which the Scripture cenſureth ſo often; and by other geſtures and habits invented to make men admire the uſer; and for which the uſer moſt of all admires himſelfe. And ſo are we influenced from without, that a coſtly furniſhed Houſe, and new faſhion'd, ſhall have a great power to corrupt the minde with this vanitie; yea and a proud carriag'd Horſe ſhall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of his vertue to his Rider, producing this Vice in him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But this low ſort of Pride though very troubleſome, frivolous, and oftentimes ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, hath more of the Child than the Man in it: For 'tis much the ſame with that Children manifeſt, when they have new Coats or Shooes given them. But there is another ſort of Pride which is properly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and ſpirituall, much more dangerous and pernicious to the affected with it, and ſtill ſo much the more fowl and damnable, as it ſeems to have ſomewhat of Religion for its foundation, and fomenter. As when men are conceited of their naturall parts, Witt, Memorie, or Reaſon: or when they reflect upon ſome accompliſhment, and faculties acquired, which lift up the Head, and caſt the Eye this way and that way, to ſee whoſe eyes are upon them, and may ſeem to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them: and who ſhall ſay, <hi>That, that</hi>'s <hi>he:</hi> which obſerved, or overheard, ſowes
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59605:112"/> the ſeed of the Serpent in the heart, which wonderfully delights the minde, ſo that ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or not at all, it can contain it ſelfe from uttering its vanity to others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But no Pride comparable to that of the Spirit, or ſpirituall Pride, properly ſo called, noted in the auncient Canons of the Church: when men ſhall preſume themſelves ſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualiz'd in gifts and religious abilities, that impatient they are of any rules of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but what proceed from their own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates and inventions. And to paſſe better undiſcover'd and unſuſpected in ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie, they diſcover themſelves very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily and inſenſibly by crying down pride in others. Much noiſe they make, and much pains they take, to beat down pride in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: For not only Faſhions, as Ribbands, Patches, Dreſſes, Geſticulations, and ſuch like, come under their ſevereſt Cenſure; but ſome they will needs have accounted proud by their very office and order, be their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall carriage never ſo inculpable in that kinde, otherwiſe. They are proud, becauſe they will not ſuffer others to be ſo. They are proud, and muſt be humbled, otherwiſe they cannot be exalted. So that I may make this the Character of a really proud perſon, that he is too ſtudious, carefull, and very active that others ſhould not be proud. For though ſome Sinners agree very lovingly
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59605:113"/> and ſide together, as the Drunkard, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous perſon, the Thief, and open Robber; they bleſſe one another, and love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers humours, and companie; the proud man is alltogether unſociable and unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and cares for none ſo much as Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants and Flatterers of him. None ſo into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to him as he who is likeſt himſelfe, and carries on the ſame trafficking for eſteem and vain-glory: Unleſſe we except ſuch, who vainly puff'd up of their fleſhly minde, would have the ſober, deliberate, and beſt compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed gifts of their Superiours, ſubject to their imaginary, raſh, petulant, ſudden flaſhes, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for purely Divine. Which to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning eye is the worſt pride of all: which becauſe it relates to ſpirituall matters may be called Spirituall; more odious to God, and more pernicious to the Soule, than that about worldly advantages preſumed on: as may appear from the fearfull judgement of God, ſinking them down to Hell alive; who denying any ſingular gifts to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> aſſumed the ſame to themſelves, and thereupon exalted themſelves above their ranks and order, and eſtabliſhed Ordinance of God. Which was much the caſe allſo of all the proud men reſiſting the Word of the Lord in the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> contrarie to their opinion and humour, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi> 43. 2. And ſo ſubtile and buſie is the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59605:113"/> Spirit ſometimes, that it diſpoſes men to be conceited of their humilitie, forſooth, it ſelfe: ſo contradicting Levitie, that they fall into moroſitie; and would confute ſuperfluities and vanities in others, by affecting indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and ſlovenneſſe in themſelves: hoping thereby to have as many admirers of them, as gayer and finer Perſons. And with as great oſtentation in the eyes of God, covet a name for Enemies to oſtentation. And we finde in the writings of the auncient and holy Fathers, a ſpeciall <hi>caveat</hi> given to them who have denyed the world in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, not to be proud of it: And ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally againſt the conceit of the excellencie of Virginitie: And Faſtings, abſtinences, and multiplied, and produced Prayers have given too great occaſion many times to appearing Saints, to become conceited. Which that good man mantioned by <hi>Gerſon</hi> in a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate <hi>Of the Tryall of Spirits,</hi> perceiving and fearing in himſelfe, prayed to God earneſtly that he might be poſſeſſed with the Devill three moneths together, to prevent ſuch an evill; chooſing rather to be infeſted with the Spirit of Pride, than infected with the Pride of Spirit; and was accordingly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God. And Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> writes in the life of Saint <hi>Hilarion,</hi> that having the gift of Miracles which he ſhewed by acts of mercie on indigent, impotent, and ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59605:114"/> that becoming noted and admired for ſuch workes, ſo ſoon as he perceived it, fled from that place, leſt he ſhould poſſibly be tainted with the corrupt breath of Fame and applauſe. The like to which we read in <hi>Aeneas Gazaeus</hi> his Dialogue called <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> or the Reſurrection of an Auncient holy Man, who being perſwaded by the importunities of a dear Friend having lately loſt his Child, to reſtore him to life again, he did ſo in a miraculous manner: and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the glorie and admiration of the people for ſo great a work, choſe to goe into vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie baniſhment. For as a wiſe and Holy Father obſerves,<note place="margin">Omnia vitia in malefact is timenda ſunt, ſuperbia in benefact is plus timenda eſt. <hi>Auguſtin. in Pſalm.</hi> 58.</note> the caſe of Pride is quite contrary to that of others. In doing evill, men are generally to feare evill; but men are to feare Pride moſt of all when they doe well. When men preach eloquently and powerfully; when others pray fluently and giftedly as they ſuppoſe, to the admiration and applauſe of others, the vain ſpirit of man licketh up, as it were, and draweth greedily to it ſelfe the fumes of praiſes offered ſo to him, as the <hi>Gentile</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers taught the paltrie Spirits of the air, (for they made ſeverall orders of Spirits too) attended the Altars at the time of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to them, and with great pleaſure
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59605:114"/> drew to themſelves the fat vapour that aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence, and were nouriſhed by the ſame, as they tell us. And if men be ſo wanting that they of themſelves refuſe to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a ſacrifice of praiſe anſwerable to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of the vain expecter; prettie ſly artifices are invented to enſnare, as it were, men to aſcribe ſomething to them: of which that is none of the leaſt or rareſt, To caſt out ſome light diſparagement of themſelves, that the Friend or flatterer may catch that occaſion to confute what was ſaid, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie his deſerts, on the contrarie, and extoll him: as it is often ſeen in young Children, who diſcerning their Parents fondneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, will ſometimes caſt themſelves down upon the ground, that they may be taken up into their armes, dandled and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But ſo much as to point at the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſorts of this Vice might require a greater latitude of Diſcourſe than is proper for this place. Ambition or affectation of great Power, or Honours, or Place is that which can hardly conſiſt with a ſincere minde, or ſpirit truely apprehenſive of the vanitie of the world, or the unſociableneſſe, I doe not ſay of the things themſelves, for ſuch orders and ſubordinations God would have in the world, but of the Affectation and appetite of them, ſo far as leaſt of all to deſire that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59605:115"/> Good work the Apoſtle mentions in Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but wholly or chiefly to deſire gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, profits, and perhaps eaſe from inferiour labours, and leſſe advantageous: becoming ſo much the leſſe ſollicitous and induſtrious as the reward requires and deſerves greater. Here muſt neceſſarily be either Vain-glorie or Covetouſneſſe or both, too prevalent.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> gives us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of vaingloriouſneſſe, and pride of minde, even after men are dead and turned to corruption; an exorbitancie Great men are ſubject to in this ſin more then in any other. For other ſins commonly end their dayes with the Sinner, but Pride divers times ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth it ſelfe after death; and Drunkenneſſe and Uncleanneſſe, and Gluttony and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe fall away with the guilty perſon: but he that is ambitious and vainglorious provides for the continuation of his blindneſſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by appointing laſting and magnificent Monuments, to that purpoſe: ſtately devices and Edifices muſt declare to Poſteritie that ſuch an one was once great and renowned, whether he were ſo or not; ay, and as now the wicked world goes, men ſhall be Sainted by an Inſcription, who have been prophane to a great degree in their lifes-time: and by ſtately Tombes, proudly, after their death, ceaſe not to prophane the Church or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell by uſurping that part of Gods Soile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59605:115"/> to Holineſſe, to the celebration of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fleſh, and drie bones; and it may be, to the bringing down the judgement of God upon that Church, which tolerates ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes when it is in its power to hinder it: which often it is not, through the power and Lordlineſſe of Great Perſons too reſolute to be diverted, and too ſtrong to be reſiſted in their unrighteous actions: eſpecially when it ſo happens that men of ſuch advantages over poor Miniſters of Chriſt and their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours too, ſhall take a kinde of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian pride in ſhewing how they can exalt themſelves above all that is called God, or reputed holy; and eſpecially in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faſhion, and that when they are dead.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Wherefore the miſchief of this Deadly evill being duly conſidered and obſerved, it will concerne every true Chriſtian truely and impartially to make enquirie into the depths of his own heart, and ſo judge his Spirit as to deliver himſelfe from the ſame. Many for kinde, are the ſorts thereof; and ſome very monſtrous for nature; all deluſive of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, procuring him Hatred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Love, contempt inſtead of eſteem and honour; and reſtleſſeneſſe of minde; ever more thirſting for that with which he can never be ſatisfied. Let us therefore take the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. and <hi>not be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59605:116"/> of vainglory, provoking one another, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying one another.</hi> And if ſuch mutuall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation were all, it were more to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; but by ſuch vainglorious provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God and Man, we ſtirr them both up to the ruine and dejecting of our ſelves, exalting our ſelves: ſome Philoſophers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo wiſe, as well as ſome Chriſtian contemplatours of the wayes and workes of God, to ſee and ſay that God ſitteth above in the higheſt Heaven obſerving who by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is capable of Exaltation, and who by exalting himſelfe deſerves to be cruſhed and confounded.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And this is it which the wiſe Man, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> Chap. 10. v. 9. teaches us; when he ſeem'd to be alltogether ignorant of the ground of Pride in Man. <hi>Why</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is earth and aſhes proud?</hi> For asking, why? it is certain, he knew not Why. Yea rather asking Why? he knew, why not. Which appeareth from what he had ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Pride is hatefull before God.</hi> And ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Pride is the beginning of ſin: and the parting from God is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</hi> Pride and Apoſtacie from God are mutuall cauſes one of another, by a kind of monſtrous inceſt begetting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but having for their common Father, the Devill himſelfe; that Apoſtate Spirit Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer, who firſt committing that ſin and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59605:116"/> condigne puniſhment for the ſame, has made it his Office to draw men into the ſame offence and condemnation, and loſſe too by aſpiring, as Holy and humble <hi>Job</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us, Chap. 41. 34. thus ſpeaking of him, <hi>He beholdeth,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> according to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Scripture, he loves and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) <hi>all high things: he is the King of all the Children of pride:</hi> that is, his own children, made ſo by pride.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And who is not ignorant of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Fleſh and blood ſhould be proud, which <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> reſolves into Earth and Aſhes. And why ſo? but becauſe Aſhes are barren of good, and Earth is baſe, ordained to be trampled on, not lifted up, but in ſuch caſes as great calamities ſeize on a man: and then it was wont to be heap'd on the head to augment his vileneſſe and miſery that brought it upon him by his folly and vanity: Man having by pride advanced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe above his originall, Earth, by as unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a courſe, as if the ſtream ſhould riſe higher than the Fountain-head, reaſon good that Earth ſhould recover its dignity and place, by becoming higher than the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous proud man.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Let not therefore</hi> (ſaith God by the Prophet <hi>Jeremie,</hi> Chap. 9. 23.) <hi>the wiſe man glorie in his wiſdome: neither let the mighty man glorie in his might: let not the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59605:117"/> rich man glorie in his riches:</hi> which is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference following upon what is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Even the Carcaſſes of men ſhall fall as dung upon the open field.</hi> Is there any ſo wiſe that he can deliver his Soule from the hand of the grave? The Pſalmiſt ſaith, no. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49. <hi>He ſeeth that wiſe men die as well as the ignorant, and fooliſh.</hi> Or can the Rich mans wealth defend him from the violence of death? Of ſuch in the ſame <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>None of them can redeem his brother, by any means: nor give to God a ranſome for him.</hi> And what is beautie more than ſtrength? Nay, it is much leſſe. For generally it fades firſt: and while it ſtaies, what is it but an apt contemperation of blood, and choler, and phlegme, and that more earthy humour, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy: which to be proud of, is much the ſame, as to be proud of fine Clothes and Faſhions, which ſuddenly alter into ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, and every night, as duely as they were put on, are put off and laid aſide. Wherefore rather as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord:</hi> that is, account it his greateſt honour and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, that he knowes God, and is educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Doctrine of Salvation: which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally inſtructeth all true Believers in the practice of humilitie.</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:59605:117"/>
                  <p n="12">12. And Humilitie alone made glorious, by the example of Chriſt, and made eaſie by the Yoke of Chriſt perſwading to it and wearing of it, and lightening it to us, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a thouſand directions to induce an ingenuous Chriſtian to the ſtudie of it, and imitation: and will wholly leavell the tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minde of man, to due compliance with the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell, and purge out the ſowre and ungratefull leaven of Pride. Therefore Chriſt exhorteth, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11.) <hi>Learne of me, for I am meek and lowly, and ye ſhall finde reſt for your Soules.</hi> Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious was the humilitie of Chriſt in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall condeſcenſions: but whether not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſtupendious it be, that after an humble God (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks) there ſhould be found a proud man, I think may be doubted. It is written of <hi>Heraclius</hi> Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> that having obtained a glorious Victorie over <hi>Coſdroes</hi> or <hi>Coſroes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he was ſo puffed up with that ſucceſſe, that he made all poſſible preparations to enter into the Gates of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> with greateſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and ſplendour; having Chriſts Croſſe carried before him: but that an Angell of God oppoſed him and ſhut the Gates againſt him, not ſuffering him to enter; but rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, ſaid, <hi>The King of heaven entred in here in mean and low eſtate:</hi> which ſo far affected him, that laying away his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall

Which made good what St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeakes and St. <hi>Peter</hi> allſo, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble:</hi> And from hence doth St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhort us to be clothed with humility, which is the true Robe of Chriſt militant, and ought to be of every one that will follow his example, and obtain his Promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Laſtly, Becauſe I know the difficulty of Selfe-deniall in this caſe, is no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the performance of this Dutie; let the generous minde conceive from thence, a reſoluteneſſe to encounter ſuch an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, as is worthy of his Chriſtian warfare here on earth: and as that Conqueſt, which muſt needs be great, and in the concluſion of all, glorious in the beſt ſenſe; becauſe difficult: but this difficultie well maſter'd wonderfully facilitates the Victorie we are to gain of the ſubordinate Vices introduced and acted principally by this leading only.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IT is requiſite, for the better detecting and purſuing of this deadly Enemie, that ſome deſcription be premiſed thereof, but more Divine than Philoſophicall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perer for other Treatiſes. Anger, therefore wrath, diſpleaſure, revenge, and violence in Spirit, Word, or Deed, is a Paſſion properly belonging to evill Spirits, and a reſemblance of them, furiouſly bent againſt God and all that are unlike themſelves. Beaſts indeed have their rage and furie, eſpecially provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but without tranſgreſſing any Rule of Reaſon preſcribed them, as angry Spirits and men doe. <hi>Woe be to the earth,</hi> ſaith the Angell in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Chap. 12. 12. <hi>For the Devill is come down unto you, having great wrath, becauſe he knoweth his time is ſhort.</hi> Not for any juſt cauſe given him, but becauſe his perverted nature impells him to indignation and furie: and by the juſt Sentence of God upon him, he rages by his Office; thus deſcribed by the Son of <hi>Sirach, Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 39. 28. <hi>There are Spirits that are created for vengeance, which in their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59605:119"/> furie, lay on ſore ſtrokes: in time of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they poure out their force, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of him that made them.</hi> By which it ſeems, there ſhould be ſome colour and cauſe for the execution of the wrath of Evill Spirits; but I know no ground for the immoderate wrath of men, but their luſt of tormenting others, contrarie to Gods inſtitution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And this <hi>Veſuvian</hi> flame worketh princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally three ſeverall wayes: ſometimes like that fierie Mountain, it frets within and conſumes its own bowells with madneſſe, wanting power and meanes to burſt out upon others. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſpits fire outwardly in horrible lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, caſts the ſame in the face of ſuch as it is incenſed againſt, calling them all to naught, and that if they be not ſo, they may be ſuch by ſuch violence offered. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times violent actions, aſſault with what comes next to hand, ſparing neither limb, nor life of ſuch as ſtand in its way: And men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done what Paſſion urged them to, they make this cold defence of their woefull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: They were in a Paſſion: making one ſin to juſtifie another: and voluntarie Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe of minde, and phrenzie, to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for the worſt of actions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is true, ſome men are by their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall temper, more cholerick than others and furious; and much more to be excuſed than
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59605:119"/> they whoſe nature is more governable, and not unhappie, but made ſo, by affected and acquired Habits of this nature. But God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bleſſed every man with Princely Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and fortified the reaſon of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian with the wiſe and grave Precepts and Documents of Religion and the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit promiſed to all that ask it at Gods hands, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. No man can reaſonably excuſe himſelfe from the guilt of ſuch intemperances, or ſay, they are not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie in him; when, as he is obliged, ſo it is in his power, to bring his Paſſions to a conformity to Reaſon and Gods Will rather than to his own turbulent humour. But when frequented exceſſes in this kinde, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed outwardly ſhall have added ſtrength and improvement to naturall inclinations, then is the Paſſion wholly owing to the will of the fomenter of it: and the neceſſity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when men ſay, I cannot endure this: I am not able to bear that: What fleſh can ſuffer this? all is to be imputed to choice and not conſtraint of nature: As if his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were one thing, and he another: or the furious habit and ſtock of Paſſion treaſured up againſt a day or occaſion of raging, by frequent leſſer acts, (as they ſay proverbial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Light gains make heavie Purſes) were not the effect of his own will, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the effects of ſuch evill habits impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his will allſo.</p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:59605:120"/>
                  <p n="4">4. It is diſputed amongſt the curious and Learned, how Fire can afflict or torment evill Spirits, that being materiall, and theſe incorporeall: And what place of torment there is wherein Fire rules and ſo rages. To which ſome have replyed, that the Fire wherewith the Devill and his Angells are tormented, they carry about them; it being, by the juſt Judgement of God, ſo inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably fixed to them, that every one carries about him his particular Hell. I have often likened the angry Mans evill temper and ſtate, to this ſort of torment. For he carries this fierineſſe allwayes about him, and is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes plagued with it himſelfe; and leſſens, as it were, his own torment by ſcattering ſparkes, whereby, as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, the courſe of Nature is ſet on fire: being a right bred Son of the Leviathan, of whome <hi>Job</hi> thus writerh, Chap. 41. 19. <hi>Out of his mouth goe burning lamps, and ſparks of fire leap out. Out of his noſtrills goeth ſmoak, as out of a ſeething Pot or Caldron. His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</hi> For ſo allſo the Angry man fumes, and fomes, and flames, ſetting all into a combuſtion, where he hath to doe, and acteth his part: and which is moſt ſtrange and Lamentable, this rage ſpareth not the authour or ſubject of it, but oftentimes haſtens Death by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies: as that famous inſtance given us
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59605:120"/> by <hi>Munſter</hi> in his <hi>Geographie,</hi> of <hi>Matthias</hi> King of <hi>Hungarie;</hi> who having on a Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday, received a Meſſage from the King of <hi>France</hi> that pleaſed him much; being at Dinner, called for his Figgs to be brought: and underſtanding that his Servant had eaten them, became ſo enraged as to fall into an Apoplexie, which bereaved him of his ſpeech, grunting only like a Beaſt for that Day, and dying the next.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When therefore men are angry (as they ſay) for nothing; as angry Soules want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of quarrelling will create it. When men are out of meaſure offended for a reall, but light cauſe, as the too hard clapping to of a Door, or a Servants letting fall of a Trencher, while he waits upon his dainty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear'd Lady at the Table, or offends others in ſome ſuch frivolous wayes, who would have it an argument of their greatneſſe to have no command of their Appetites any more than of their Paſſions? When men ſhall be too frequent in their cholerick humour, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that nothing can doe well without that Engine which mars all; then may they well be aſſured, they are much out of the way themſelves, having loſt the command of themſelves, and in no likelihood to govern others as behoveth them. For Saint <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the Will of God;</hi> meaning, that God ſeldome
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59605:121"/> proſpereth that with a good ſucceſſe, which Choler principally ſetteth on foot. For this were for God to bleſſe Vices. Yea, where it is the Will of God that a thing ſhould be done, as Vice in its ſeverall kindes reproved by ſuch eſpecially whoſe place and office it is ſo to doe, yet if zeal be tranſported into Anger, ſo that it appeares to be the effect of Choler rather than Conſcience; or it ſeems to be an enmity againſt the Perſon rather than his offence, men arme themſelves with obſtinacie againſt ſuch attempts of reducing or correcting them. And daily Anger, is no better than daily Phyſick, to move drye and ſlow bodies: ſeldome uſed, it may doe good: but conſtantly, hath no power over them. For it will then too juſtly be ſuſpected, what is commonly too apparent, that men gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily catch at occaſions to be offended, not out of ill will to the Vice, or faults commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor out of good will to the offender to be amended, but to ſatiate their humour and pleaſe themſelves in their proper and dear Vice: many, divers times, being really leſſe diſpleaſed at the crime committed, than they are pleaſed with the opportunity offered of exerciſing their angrie facultie.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Be inſtructed then, and perſwaded, true Chriſtian Soule, in what becomes thee in this Caſe. Wilt thou entertain ſuch a Gueſt within thee, which will turne thee, I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59605:121"/> mean the beſt part of thee, thy Reaſon and Religion, out of doors? Or wilt thou tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy ſelfe moſt dangerouſly to afflict o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Seeſt thou not from whence wrath proceeds? Seeſt thou not whither it tends? namely, to put thee beſide thy ſelfe, as a temporarie madneſſe, or drye Drunkenneſſe; to prey upon the very Vitalls, to precipitate thy latter end; to have no content but what is found in Hell, by tormenting and being tormented; to open a door to divers miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs publick and private, perſonall, and ſociall. For if that be true, which upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the Auncient Hermite delivers for ſuch; That a man cannot live Chaſtly, as he ought, that is given to Anger, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Luſt, till he be maſter of this, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins doth this one expoſe him unto, ſeeing that the unnaturall heat which lurketh in the Angrie man, is indifferent to the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other ſins, as well as that?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider with thy ſelfe, how frail thou art thy ſelfe, and apt to offend, and that ſometimes unfortunately and unwillingly; and doe not allwayes interpret the errours or failings of others as purpoſed: much leſſe, anticipate by raſh conjecture, that to be done which perhaps was not done nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; to the end thou mayeſt indulge to thy ſelfe the wonted pleaſure of fretting and ſtorming without cauſe; and ſo with ſhame
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59605:122"/> thou beeſt conſtrain'd to muſter up thy Forces, and glory what thou wouldſt have done, upon occaſion, but art fain to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, as upon a falſe Alarm; yet leaſt thou ſhouldſt be up for nothing, ſhouldſt fall fowl one way or other, before Choler will be quiet, upon the undeſerving.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is no good ground of wrath againſt another, that thou being wiſer than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhouldſt either deride, or rage againſt the folly of him; but a true Chriſtian ſhould conſider, that he whoe ſuffers men to be borne and live with crooked limbes or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily parts, doth permitt ſome crooked Soules to abide in bodies: and therefore ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pittie and endeavour to rectifye them, than to expoſe them to ſhame, or inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, thereby contracting the like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe to that condemned by them. <hi>We that are ſtrong,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.) <hi>ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves:</hi> eſpecially by diſpleaſing others, and God eſpecially.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And the better to cruſh the Viper of Anger in us, ſtinging all that come nere us, we muſt note, that, as Pride is the beginning of all ſins and wickedneſſe, the contrary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue Humilitie is the mother of all Chriſtian Vertues. This foundation then muſt be laid here allſo; otherwiſe all repairs of the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Soule will be fruſtrated. For where
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59605:122"/> Humility is wanting, a thouſand falſe phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of our perfections, and merits will ſwell the minde above its proper height, and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſo that every little thing will ſtand in its way, and offend it. For men ſuſpecting themſelves undervalued by others (as they doe and needs muſt, who overvalue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) preſently the vindicative Spirit falls to work by word and deed, to ſatiate it ſelfe upon detractours, as it accounts them, miſtakenly, childiſhly, and madly at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Where therefore true Humility is found, Meekneſſe will not be far diſtant, nor long abſent. And where Meekneſſe dwells, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Choler will have but cold enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. And to the Spirit of Meekneſſe, doe much conduce a Diſcipline and cohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impoſed on the outward man. It is often alledged by the riotous minde, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear that abuſe, or this affront, or ſuch contempt, or diſobedience, or neglect; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo adviſed as I ſhould be: But no man can ſay, that profeſſes manlineſſe and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but he can move or hold his hand; and can ſpeak or keep ſilence, or compoſe the outward parts of his body, or ſuffer them to break out into diſorders: which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment when he hath obtained over himſelfe outwardly, and for a time practiſed, he ſhall finde a conſiderable change in his inward
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59605:123"/> man, in due time; and the heat allayed, and a wonderfull calme and tranquillitie, with admiration that he ſhould heretofore be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in a ſtorme frivolouſly occaſioned. And as it is obſerved that too hot mettall'd Horſes which are apt to run away with their Riders, are no wayes better tamed and taken off their courage, than by accuſtoming them to walk a foot-pace: ſo modeſt and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate actions outwardly will in time qualifie the impetuouſneſſe of the minde. It were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well worth a mans labour, attendance, and time, to bend his minde reſolutely for tryall of his ſtrength, and what Maſtery he hath of himſelfe, to act, though an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling part of patience, and to prove how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable he is againſt wonted provocations: and having ſome few times hardened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt ſuch provokings, it will become eaſie to doe and ſuffer the ſame in earneſt, even when the like caution and attendance are not uſed.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But becauſe there are certain jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and cauſes which doe allmoſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſpoſe to anger; ſuch as are Sickneſſe, and Pampering the Bodie, making it thereby more than one way, reſty: immoderate Cups, and even Faſtings, rarely uſed; and ſuch as the Bodie is not accuſtomed to, and ſome other, which juſtle, as it were, nature out of its Rode, and ſo offends it: Great
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59605:123"/> circumſpection is, in ſuch caſes, to be uſed. And in trueth ſuch exceſſes are wholly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to be avoided, as they which blinde the eyes of Reaſon, inſlame the Blood, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate the Spirits to act violently: And Abſtinences or Faſtings themſelves, ſtand in need of watchings over a mans diſpoſition. For as all things are moleſted inwardly by denyall of wonted food, and naturally complain; ſo the Body of man being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of its ordinarie ſupply and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is apt to be murmuring, diſcontented, and querulous, untill it be better acquainted with ſuch changes: and fretting and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings within will goe nere to vent themſelves outwardly, upon ſuch as ſhall ſtand in their way, and converſe with them: Care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be taken, not (as ſome may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre) to ſhun faſting, but to bridle, at ſuch times eſpecially, the ſharp humour which may ſtir up ſtrife or diſcontent, leſt the good be evill ſpoken of: or a ſcandall brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Chriſtian Dutie, by ſome misbehaviour conſequent thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And to the better preventing of ſuch ebullitions of the Spirit, it is requiſite a man ſhould carefully avoid ſuch Paſſion, when it ſeems to carrie much innocencie and veniall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with it. For it ſeems to divers no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence allmoſt, to be angrie as <hi>Balaam</hi> was, with his Beaſt; to be in Choler againſt Dogs,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59605:124"/> that will not hunt, and Hawks that will not flie, againſt Horſes that will not goe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our mindes: and ſome think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves excuſable when their Choler is high only, againſt their Servants; but all with a dangerous errour. For as much as libertie being allowed to a mans ſelfe in ſuch caſes, Fleſh and Blood will not long contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in thoſe bounds, but being accuſtomed to ſuch heats and perturbations, will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, where perhaps they never intended. For by ſuch uſances tolerated, men become eaſily inflameable, and their blood, afore they are aware, is as it were ſowr'd, and diſpoſing to other exceſſes, and that upon occaſions, leſſe warrantable.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And upon the ſame reaſon, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection is to be had, how a man is offended and angrie with himſelfe: for ſome men have held it verie laudable ſo to be; and ſome have been religiouſly vindicative upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves by ſevere Penances for their follies and offences againſt God and others, which muſt not be diſallowed, when governed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prudence, which many times being wanting, a man puniſhes one ſin by another, and offers unnaturall violence to himſelfe; which is worſe than to doe the ſame to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that herein is requiſite the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and conduct of others, no leſſe than in Controverſies of treſpaſſes againſt a mans
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59605:124"/> Neighbour: to whome he would ſeldome doe juſtice, if he were Accuſer, Judge, and Executioner too. And ſo not rarely, men tranſported with a religious Paſſion againſt themſelves, (as it may ſeem) offend in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing offences. And this is ſeen in caſes extra-religious; men fretting, and ſtorming, and raging, that matters under their hands, ſucceed not according to their mindes, and merits. They will miſcall themſelves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of themſelves, and be enraged: as if no man had ſo ill luck as they, or did ſo ill as they: and this doing, hold themſelves very excuſable, becauſe none but themſelves, ſuffer hereby. But there is herein common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a double errour. For firſt they who give way to any exorbitances againſt themſelves, prepare a way to be injurious and furious againſt others, much more: and that upon the reaſon here given. But ſecondly, what ſeemeth to be, ſeldome is really ſo. And men fretting and in a toſſe againſt themſelves, to outward appearance, are in trueth incenſed againſt Gods Providence, or perhaps their tutelarie Angells, not doing their parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, in giving better events to their good actions. <hi>For no man</hi> (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>ever hated his own fleſh,</hi> or himſelfe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally; and no man that is ſupernaturally, or by Grace vindicative upon himſelfe, can lightly fall into ſuch paſſions, and therefore
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59605:125"/> inconſiderately accuſes others of his miſtakes and miſcarriages; who can be no other than the mentioned, whether he intends ſo much, or not. Some inſtances may make this more probable: as, When he miſſes a thing he had in his hand a little before; and cannot ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly finde it for his preſent uſe: When the Joiner having uſed ſufficient Art and care, cannot make a joint: When ſome little thing is ſo forgot in ſetting together a Watch or Clock, that when all was ſuppoſed to be ended, it muſt be taken apieces again. When ſuch a ſnarl is made in a skean of Silk or Thred, that the thred muſt be broken; men are apt to frett at higher cauſes than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which they vulgarly call Luck, or Fortune, really no where extant. And when <hi>Cyrus</hi> (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writes) in a furie laid <hi>Gyndes,</hi> a River in <hi>Armenia,</hi> dry, by cutting three hundred and ſixty Rivolets out of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one of his white Naggs dedicated to the Sun, was drowned in it; could not be ſo ſtupid to think that the River merited that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſhewed his rage againſt that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it could not reach higher cauſes; how much wiſer man had he been, if he had put a ſtop to the torrent of his Paſſion? which is much more the wiſedome and Piety of a Good Chriſtian: whome God ſuffereth, many times, to be provoked, that the prevalence of true Grace may be ſeen in maſtering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59605:125"/> and ſometimes ſuffereth to become fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, waſpiſh, and ready to ſting him that ſtands next him, upon either no fault but his own, or verie frivolous; and ſo, if any hath offended him in ſuch manner, he puniſhes the innocent for it; making ſuch as converſe with him to feel the effects of his imbitter'd Spirit: than which there needs no cleerer argument to convince any ingenuous minde of his exceſſe: it being but tolerable to be in Paſſion where the cauſe is given; and not ſo, to extend the ſame to the faultleſſe. This therefore, all Reaſon and Religion re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quires to be corrected by the conſcientious Chriſtian.</p>

And a more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible inſtance than that is given in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſtory of the miſchief of Maliciouſneſſe, in <hi>Nicephorus</hi> an Old Monk, and <hi>Sapritius</hi> a young Profeſſour; who being had in greater eſteem than the other, gave unwillingly ſuch great offence to him, that he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him, and would admitt of no humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reconciliation, till the Spirit of Grace wholly deſerting him, when both were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to martyrdome, the young man ſuffered cheerfully and conſtantly, but the Old en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Father denied Chriſt. So that moſt truely as well as Divinely, ſaid <hi>Solomon, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> 27. 4. <hi>Wrath is cruell and Anger is outragious, but whoe is able to ſtand before envie?</hi> A reaſon whereof may be that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 55. <hi>If it had been an open Enemy that had done this, I could have borne it,</hi> &amp;c. Anger, and wrath are acts of open hoſtilitie, and may better be either oppoſed or declined, than the dark Plotts, and privie wounds which Envie giveth to its Enemie; and, which declares its mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſneſſe and unnaturallneſſe, to its Friend; who indulging to himſelfe that Vice, like the Vulture in the Fable, preyeth upon the Liver: and nothing commendable in it is to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59605:128"/> be found, but what Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> acutely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, ſaying, <hi>Envye is good for nothing but to miſchief the owner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Againſt this Evill, the remedie may be, Firſt, to conſider the abſolute Maſter God All-mighty is of his own; and that all things we enjoy are more properly Gods than ours who have the uſe of them: And that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at the happineſſe or proſperitie of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to call in queſtion Gods Wiſdome and Juſtice in ordering his Familie, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome of his Servants in higher places, and giving them greater Offices, than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: without which the world could not be well adminiſter'd or ſubſiſt. And the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Spirit ſhould conſider, that if the quite contrary were appointed, and thou who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt anothers greatneſſe in Riches, Honour, or Proſperity in the world wert ſuch, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious eye might as juſtly dart its ſpitefull arrow againſt thee, as thou doeſt againſt him: and ſo never would there be quiet and content in the world. Let that righteous Document therefore here take place, <hi>Doe as thou wouldſt be done to,</hi> and envie no more than thou wouldſt be envied in the like caſes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Secondly, Learne to ſeek the honour of God, and to preferre that above all things in the world: and become like to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative nature of God, who giveth to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59605:129"/> all men, yea to all things liberally, and grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. If that which is beſtowed upon another went out of thy ſtore, and thou wert leſſe great becauſe another was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thee; or thou looſedſt ſo much of thy beautie as another is fairer than thou art; or thou wert the leaner becauſe another was fatt and fairer: If there were fear that Gods Fountain would be ſo exhauſted, by the affluence another enjoyeth from him; that there remained not ſufficient for thee, then, like hungrie Currs feeding greedily at the ſame Carcaſe, men might worrey one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or if what was given to any but our ſelves, were loſt to God, then murmuring and envying might be more tolerable: but 'tis far otherwiſe: the Univerſall Good, and Giver is not diminiſhed or impoveriſhed by the plentie of another more than of thee. And ſo the Nation is no leſſe Learned when another excells, than when thou: And the Kingdome is as honourable, and ſtrong, and proſperous, and happie, when another is in place, and power, and flouriſhes as much, and poſſibly more than when thou: excepting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall imperfections and infirmities, to which thou art as ſubject as another; and much more art to be ſuſpected of future perſonall failings and errours, as thou more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently aymeſt at great things and coveteſt an evill covetouſneſſe to thy ſelfe. For
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59605:129"/> ſeldome is it ſeen that he, who moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſtrives for great Places, Commands, Dignities, or Riches, uſes them as he ought to doe, when he attains them. But as it happened to the luſting <hi>Iſraelites, Pſal.</hi> 106. 15. <hi>He gave them their requeſt, but ſent leanneſſe into their ſoules:</hi> God filleth ſome mens Bellies, and Purſes, but leanneſſe and emptineſſe afflicteth their Soules. And what a bad exchange is that? and how much more to be pittied than envied?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. On the other ſide, Thirdly, conſider we what benefits in ſingular manner, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and meaſure God may have dealt to us, which he denies to others, objects of our envie; and a ſtay and ſtop will neceſſarily be put to that Diſtemper. Are not, trueth, humilitie, quiet, and tranquillitie allmoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Perſons of low Spheres and mean For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and Innocencie, much better obſerv'd in contemning than courting the world, to be preferred before thoſe tempting opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of tranſgreſſing by fullneſſe and Power? While the weak eyes of the envious are dazled at the luſtre of others, if they could reflect upon themſelves and duely weigh all circumſtances, they may finde cauſe to bleſſe themſelves in the ſolider part of happineſſe, above the envied, and therein to acquieſce, caſhiering ſuch an ignoble Paſſion.</p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59605:130"/>
                  <p n="8">8. Fourthly, If men thorowly conſider'd the chief Authour of Envie in a man, and that the Devill is he who both gives force, and findes materialls for this Sin to work by, he would hate it as the pit of Hell, and the Prince of darkneſſe himſelfe. For St. <hi>Baſil</hi> (that great Philoſopher as well as Divine) ſuppoſing what Poets and naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers deliver of the malice or miſchievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of an envious Eye, doubteth not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that it proceeds from the influence of the Devill; who tempereth his Poiſon with the raies of the eye of the Spirit embittered with Envie, ſhot at the envied Perſon to his ruine, divers times. Unleſſe therefore men reſolve to preferre the Devill before Chriſt, as he that is more ſerviceable to the luſts of men, dreadfull ſhould this notorious Vice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all good Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But we not having ſo learn'd Chriſt, nor Chriſt having ſo taught us, but rather often inclucated by Precept, and by Example led us to that heavenly Vertue, Charitie; let that as comprehending many, if not all meanes of purging out this old Leaven of Malice, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, be the laſt argument now to be uſed, to that end. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is the very bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> Coloſſ. 3. 14. <hi>Charitie, or love, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the Law.</hi> Rom. 13. 8. and <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Love worketh no evill to his Neighbour.</hi> And
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59605:130"/> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> Chap. 13. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Charitie ſuffereth long and is kinde, Charitie envieth not, Chartie vaunteth not it ſelfe, is not puffed up; Doth not behave it ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly; Rejoyceth not in iniquitie, but rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the trueth, Beareth all things, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things:</hi> Which whoſoever ſo doeth, cannot envie; nor ſeek nor deſire the evill of another, nor rejoice at any evill befalling any other, as if thereby ſome good had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him; which is the guiſe of Envie. Wherefore, O Lord, who knoweſt that all our doings without Charitie are nothing worth, pour into my heart that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gift of Charitie, the proper Antidote againſt this Poiſon of Envie, hatred, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and the very ſoule of all Chriſtian Graces, and the Earneſt of, and key to Glorie, and that fire of unquenchable bleſſedneſſe, contrarie to that unquenchable fire of Hell, where the Devill and his Angells are tormented: that fo for his fake, and through his Spirit, who <hi>loved us and gave himſelfe for us,</hi> I may with faithfull, ſervent, and never failing Charitie, love thee who haſt firſt loved me, and in thee, and for thee, all, as they belong to Thee, through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. XIV. Of the Capitall Sin, Covetouſneſſe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. I Have ſometimes doubted and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how the exceſſive Declamations found in humane Authours, and the ſharpeſt Cenſures found in Holy Writ can be true of ſeverall Vices, as if more than one were worſt of all: For ſometimes Pride is the originall of all Evill: and ſometimes <hi>Covetouſneſſe</hi> is ſaid to be the Root of all Evill, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. And than which nothing can be ſaid more ſeverely againſt any Sin, the Apoſtle adviſeth concerning Covetouſneſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Let it not be once named amongſt you, as becometh Saints.</hi> For what, indeed, can worſe become Saints, whoſe converſation is in Heaven, than to fall flat upon the earth, and like Moles, to work in it. And, <hi>There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But comparing the Diſeaſes of the Soule, with the diſtempers of the Body, ſome ſatisfaction may be given of ſuch exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating formes of Speech. For as the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of naturall Bodies cannot ſo well be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated from their kindes, as from the degree of affecting; and the danger from the part
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59605:131"/> ſo affected: ſo is it with the evills of the Soule. For a Pin thruſt into one part, may be more mortall than a Sword run through another. And oft-times, the pain of the Tooth is leſſe tolerable than the Gout in Feet or Joints: and a lighter diſtemper at the Heart more dangerous than a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the outward parts. And thus may Pride be the chief and worſt of ſinnes of a ſpirituall nature: and Covetouſneſſe may be the root of all Evill tending to bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and brutiſh pleaſure, though it taketh the leaſt ſenſible pleaſure of any, but only treaſures up materialls for all other Vices, and impells to monſtrous deſires and actions. For gaping, and hungry as the unſatiable Grave, and dilating its ſtomach as Hell; it fetches from thence allſo helliſh appetites, contriveth plotts to catch its unjuſt prey, or moſt unjuſtly hoardeth up and detaineth what perhaps not unjuſtly was acquired. Or if at any time it letteth goe abroad part of its Magazine; it is, as Garriſons ſend out Parties, to bring in more ſpoil, by pilling and robbing the Country, that is, by Uſurie and extortion, or Money lent moſt diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly to the borrower.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Certain old Stories doe commonly paſſe of ſome Caves, Hills or holes of the Earth, wherein are great Treaſures of Gold and Silver, and precious Stones; but ſo, that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59605:132"/> they are kept by Dragons, or evill Spirits from being carried out, and become uſefull to men. Very true is this of Wealth in the poſſeſſion of Covetous Perſons. There it is to be found; but thence it may not be taken, by any meanes: For 'tis kept by Evill Spirits ſo cloſe, that the pretended owner himſelfe ſcarce durſt touch it. For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>What good is there to the owner of them, ſaving the beholding of them with the eyes?</hi> Eccleſiaſt. 5. v. 11. And yet this is not all: but <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>There is a ſore evill which I have ſeen under the Sun, Riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt:</hi> A double da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage generally happening to the Amaſſers of Wealth: One to the wicked treaſurer of it; while the more he hath, the more he wants; and the more he poſſeſſeth, the leſſe he enjoyeth. And therefore very aptly in our Engliſh Tongue, we call a Covetous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Miſerable Perſon, as moſt unhappie of all men. And it proveth a ſore evill to him for whome it is ſo gathered: the Poſterity of the Covetous Perſon ſcattering with like, though contrary pleaſure, as the Father ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered: and by prodigious Prodigality haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Grave, and ſo to Hell for ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as his Predeceſſour, for ſparing. And the Evill Spirit that ſtopt the courſe of due ſpending, now, on a ſuddain drawes up the Sluce, and drowns the Country with Vice
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59605:132"/> and Vanity managed for a ſhort ſeaſon by Money. But to begin the torment of the Covetous in this life, he is told by trueth it ſelfe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 8. <hi>He that by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury and unjuſt gain encreaſeth his ſubſtance, he ſhall gather for him that will pitty the poor:</hi> a thing which he dreadeth moſt of all, who ſo hoardeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But another Reaſon may be given why St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Covetouſneſſe the root of all Evill,</hi> taking here Evill, for Puniſhment, and future Torments. For I am of opinion, that Covetouſneſſe ſends more griſt to the Devills Mill; and finds more Fewell for to maintain Hell-fire than any other Sin, infidelity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps excepted. For very many great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the dayes of their youth and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, drawing towards the end of their lives, have ſeriouſly and ſavingly repented; chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their mindes and manners, finding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the effect of Gods bountifull Promiſes, and Goodneſſe. But Covetouſneſſe, like an inveterate Cancer in the Fleſh, the older it is, the more it proceeds, and conſumes the Bodie and Soule. Seldome doe men repent of their parſimonie and baſeneſſe in their youth, but often of their profuſeneſſe and licentiouſneſſe. And not ſo ſeldome as it were to be wiſhed, ſo raſhly retreat from their former Errours, that they run into the contrary Vice of Covetouſneſſe, from which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59605:133"/> very few returne. But the old Sinner thinks he makes God ſome recompence for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Vices; and doubts not but he repents notably, if he declaims againſt young mens, and his own expences in fooliſh Faſhions, in riotous Companie, in coſtly Dames of the worſt rank; and ſuch like miſcarriages of youth, and ſees not that another Sin is to be repented of, and his baſe ſparing ſhall but adde to his puniſhment for baſe ſpending. Here comes in a Mock-gravity, Sobrietie, Temperance, Continence, zeal againſt all ſins but that he is lately wedded to, and embraces as fondly as any he did formerly: to the apparent hazard of his Soule, miſtaking change of ſins, for Repentance and Reformation of Life. Whereas the Rule and Power of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for our former ſins, is, to act contrarie unto them; and in this caſe eſpecially, when we have in youth ill ſquander'd the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie goods, God hath lent to us for a ſeaſon, not to be tenacious of them, in age, but to employ them as freely in the ſervice of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Pietie exiled by coſtly Luſts. And not be like that unjuſt old Uſurer and Oppreſſour, of whome <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington</hi> ſpeakes, who being exhorted, towards his Death, to give Almes plentifully, towards the expiation of his wicked Covetouſneſſe, refuſed, ſaying: No, I will leave my Son all I have got; and let him, if he pleaſes, give Almes out of it, for the good of my Soule.</p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:59605:133"/>
                  <p n="5">5. It is therefore the advice of our Lord and Maſter Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Take heed, and beware</hi> (as if one word ſufficed not to obviate ſuch a peſtilent Diſeaſe) <hi>of Covetouſneſſe. For a mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth.</hi> Take we heed of it, for the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick evill in it ſelfe; and beware of it, for the viperous brood of ſins which it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth and nouriſheth: ſome of which may be theſe: Obduration of heart againſt God and Man: being unſenſible of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Worſhip, Thankfullneſſe, and fruitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all good works, the end of his bountie to man in that kinde. And a hard heart, and barren womb towards the neceſſities of his Brother craving ſome little of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. Yea, cruell is the covetous to his own fleſh, denying what may be convenient for the ſame: and no better to his minde, tormenting it with reſtleſſe and endleſſe cares, to adde to the unprofitable heap, and bring about that deſigne which never comes to paſſe: For he tells others firſt, he deſires but an honeſt livelihood, but having attained to that; he proceeds and tells us, He would willingly leave a competent ſubſiſtence to his Wife and Children: and having gained that Point allſo, then he is no leſſe ſollicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that competencie, never knowing when he hath it, though he hath it: but would
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59605:134"/> make his Poſterities rich too, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Eſquires and Knights, and Nobles, if it were poſſible, and what not? Then ſhould he ſleep ſweetly in his Grave: and for his Soule, it is the leaſt part of his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude. But if doing no good, or doing no evill but to himſelfe, were the evill in which the Covetous man was only guilty, it were a laudable ſin (if any may be ſaid ſo to be) in compariſon of the wicked Pranks it plaies upon other. What Choler and wrath rages not at a triviall loſſe, which a liberall Soule would not be moved at, or ſtirred? Break but an earthen Veſſell of two pence, you allmoſt break his heart; and if he breakes your Head, it is leſſe than can be expected from him. Violences, Frauds, Cheatings, treacheries to God, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for lucre: Perverting Juſtice by Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: ſubverting the Faith, and confounding Religion by Simonie, and Sacriledge; which he laughs out of countenance, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand the tryall of ſuch iniquitie: or boldly asking, What is Sacriledge? What is Simonie? baffles all received Knowledge and perſwaſion thereof, by his acute and ſingular Scepticiſm, trampling on Reaſon and Juſtice, and Religion all at once. Adde hereunto Lying, Perjuries, Stealings, Rapines, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit raiſed to himſelfe by depopulations of Pariſhes, reducing the well-inhabited Place
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59605:134"/> to one or two great Farmes; taking up a ſtrange Paradox for his Defence, that there are, notwithſtanding, never the fewer People, becauſe Nature will work in an unknown Manner, and Land. How manifeſtly hath experience taught us what the Prophet <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi> denounceth againſt ſuch Engroſſers, Chap. 2. 9. <hi>Woe to him that coveteth an evill covetouſneſſe to himſelfe, that he may ſet his nest on high,</hi> &amp;c. For in trueth, I have by me, many Inſtances of curſes upon Perſons and Families, who by ſuch ill wayes of advancing themſelves, have, in a ſhort time, been utterly ruin'd: But I will not trouble this Diſcourſe with them. So as that is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them, which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> hath, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 75. 5. according to the auncienter Tranſlation: <hi>The proud are robbed, they have ſlept their ſleep: and all the men whoſe hands are mighty, have found nothing.</hi> Great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they graſped at in their projectings; but in the concluſion, they were forced to let goe what before they held; and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. But above all this, men ſhould ſeriouſly conſider, there is more guilt in this ſin, than is obvious to every eye, eſpecially having in it the Pearl of Covetouſneſſe; and that is no leſſe, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be believed, than Idolatrie. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 5. Mammon being erected in the heart, the Temple of God; and preferred before God, <hi>and all that are called
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59605:135"/> Gods:</hi> which is the Character of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And the conſideration of theſe Evills may more than ſufficiently diſſwade the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of theſe earthly Riches, which make us poor towards God: But does not Chriſt the Oracle of God tell us, as we have it, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>It is better to give than to receive?</hi> And the reaſon hereof is not obſcure: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it maketh us like unto God, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto all men liberally; yea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. <hi>Openeth his hand, and filleth all things li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with plenteouſneſſe.</hi> And believe we <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> the wiſeſt of Men, rather than relye on our own witts naturall: he telleth us, that, <hi>The Liberall ſoule ſhall be made fat.</hi> Not unlike to thoſe Breaſts which abound by being drawn: but are dried up and emptie, by denying what they have to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to others, by Gods and Natures appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And there is but one or two main Objections which the Covetous is wont to alledge for his tenaciouſneſſe, and againſt Bountie and Charitie, eſpecially towards Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good. Charitie of that nature is much perverted and abuſed to evill ends: Which if the trueth were plainly known, is not the reall reaſon of ſuch Perſons illiberality; but the love of Money. But be it ſo: Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deeds are perverted to ill uſes; ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactions
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59605:135"/> made with pious intentions, ſhall never be wreſted by any abuſes, out of the hands of the giver, but his reward ſhall be with the Lord, and that an hundred fold. Beſides, to whome can the ſubtilleſt World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling give or leave his Eſtate ſo ſecurely as it ſhall not, or may not be abuſed? He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe abuſed it and himſelfe many times, in getting it, and keeping it, which, as dung, ought to be ſpread abroad to make the Soil fruitfull. And doth not Riches left to the dear Heirs of our Bodies ſuffer, and doe more miſchief to them than Good? Doe they not abuſe them in rioting, Luxurie, and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Drunkenneſſe? Who would have thought that the Covetous Perſon ſhould be a man of ſo much mercie as to bring the abuſe and miſchief of Wealth home to his own Familie, rather than the Church, or State ſhould be the worſe for his freeneſſe? But ſo experience often teaches us, to fall out. Whereas by ſparing ſomewhat out of that we enjoy, to Gods Service, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſanctified, and by Gods bleſſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more durable. Therefore, <hi>O Man of God flee theſe things,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe. And let the judgement of him who <hi>was made Wiſdome and Sanctification</hi> to us be preferred before the ſhort reaſonings of a worldly wiſe head, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 15. <hi>Take heed, and beware of Covetouſneſſe: for a mans life
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59605:136"/> conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth:</hi> nor indeed the life of his Familie, or Poſteritie: but Gods Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>

Luxurie is ſometimes taken for generall indulgence to carnall Senſes, and the pleaſures proceeding from them: from whence that ſpeciall Vice muſt needs become Rampant, which wars againſt both Puritie of Minde and Chaſtitie of Body: and may be ſaid to be an inordinate luſting of the Fleſh tending to prohibited pollution. When the vain minde of man following the errour of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> conſulting with the more youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and precipitant faculties and inclinations of a man, we turne a deaff ear to the ſober and grave Dictates of Reaſon and Religion interdicting our courſe; letting all looſe, and giving the reins out of our hands, permitting
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59605:136"/> our ſelves to be hurried down-hill with an eaſie, and ſuddain Paſſion, we know not, we care not, we conſider not, whither: till like the blinde Souldiers of <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> our eyes being at length opened, we finde our ſelves captivated in the Citie of our Deadly Enemie, the Devill ſeducing us away.</p>

And if we conſult auncient Hiſtories, we ſhall finde, that the greateſt and moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſubverſions of Nations, have been occaſioned by immoderate and unjuſt luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

What diſtempers and Diſeaſes of the Bodie arreſt the Carrier of luſts? Pains in the Head, Gouts in the Limbs, Dropſies in the whole Bodie, Feavers in the Blood, and rottenneſſe in the Bones and very Marrow; ſo turning the Comedie of ſuch love into Tragicall Notes, and Lamentations, running on this ſtrain principally: <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant, I was as a Beaſt before thee, Pſal.</hi> 73. 22.

To which my anſwer is: That though this Sin may have provoked the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to complain of it, yet never found it ſuch favour with them as to be approved, or patiently tolerated. For naturall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the Righteous are not extinguiſht, and the Law of the Fleſh doth war ſtrongly againſt the Law of the minde: but ſtill the godly and ſpirituall Man maintains the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and keeps the Field, as it were, againſt the Armes of the Mighty: and though many wounds may be received, yet is he not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59605:138"/> And if at any time unhappily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone, renews the Conflict, and recovers his former ſtation with advantage, by double guards ſet about his Soule; and diligence, which re-ingratiates him into the favour of Allmighty God our heavenly Father; who remembreth that we are but fleſh, while we contend to be ſpirituall. But it is chiefly the captivating the will by ſuch tryalls of our ſtrength and conſtancie, which God diſlikes; and a conſent habituall, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting, and unrepenting yieldings, which put us out of Gods favour, and diſtinguiſhes from the Saints, who perhaps have never been free from temptation, nor reſted ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſervilitie of the Sin. But for any man to connive at leſſer failings in him in this kinde, as but wandring thoughts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected admiration of Beauties, evill inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inward concupiſcences without execution, and much more, actions impure, is to be overcome and looſe all, unleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Repentance again.</p>

For what a miſerable ſhuffling and evaſion is that, and plain inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to lay the blame and defects of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon the dutie performed by them. No doubt therefore, the univerſall Churches judgement and practice is much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the opinion of moderne and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Apologiſts for illimited uſe of ſenſuall gratifications, and oppoſers of Bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and diſciplining of the Appetites, even to the denying of things not in themſelves unlawfull, as conducing to Chaſtitie. Though the ſubjecting of the inward affections and luſts is more noble, more neceſſarie, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable, as that to which the other ſhould tend, and in which, end. It was the courſe Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> writeth he took with himſelfe

                  <p n="9">9. Thirdly, It is very requiſite to avoid vain and vile communication; which Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (ratifying the opinion of the Gentile Poet) aſſures us begets evill manners. And therefore adviſes farther, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your

For all theſe, like the Eſtriches Egges covered, perhaps for a time, in the Sand, untill the warm Sun ſhall ripen and enliven them, will quicken in the minde of man in the heat of temptation, or perhaps will of themſelves, break forth into a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and receive conſummation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine of Saint <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>A man is drawn away thus and enticed.

For all theſe ſenſible inſinuations of unlawfull Luſts, yea acts Lawfull to them that uſe them in a regular way, become Images in the minde, which the natural man turnes to, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and falls down before, worſhipping them, and idolizing them to his ſhame and fall.</p>

Fourthly, Let it be conſider'd, what honour God doth to the chaſt Soule, and Body, in that he eſteems them as his own Temple: Chriſt and looks upon them as his own Members in eſpeciall manner. And, on the contrary, how ill he taketh tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, in this kinde. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

                  <p n="11">11. Laſt of all, Conſider we, what a concatenation of other Vices is found too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this one, and the reaſon will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, why it is accounted a Mother-ſin. For though Harlots are ſeldome fruitfull, the ſin of Whoredome is. We hear much ſpoken of ſimple Fornication, as minutely peccant, in the opinion of divers: But doth not that beget baſeneſſe of Spirit, and, as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, lowneſſe of underſtanding, nothing caſting down the wit of man more from its top and Tower, than ſuch inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love of Women? Nothing makeing a man more contemptible and ridiculous than that known Vice. But that is not all. For from hence comes waſting of Eſtates, as the Hiſtory of the Prodigall cleerly proveth. Hence allſo proceeds Quarrelling, and Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; as it is amongſt Dogs when they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Bitch that runs proud: And Murders follow them; and too often, to avoid the ſhame of the world, is deſtroyed with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Potions, or Pills, the fruit of the wombe, before it ripens; and which is worſe, are not ſenſible of that more heinous ſin in covering ſin, than of uncleanneſſe contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which they ought to be; and therefore ſeldome repent of it as they ought to doe. But when Nature ſhall have weather'd that Rock, yet open violence is too often offer'd to the tender Innocent, in barbarous manner.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59605:141"/> And when it comes not to this, yet how doe noble and great Perſons, many times offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this manner, become ſo vile as to ſtand in awe of their Foot-boyes, and Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, privie to their wickedneſſe, that they may keep their counſell. So that the fact is diſhoneſt and diſhonourable, the pleaſure momentarie and fugitive, the puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and durable, even in this life; and in the world to come unquenchable, by any thing, but timely and plentifull teares, here poured out to prevent the ſame.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IT is obſerved by Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> that the Seats of Incontinence and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance are by nature placed nere together; intimating the nere relation they bear one to another, and the mutuall aid they give to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance one another. For extravagant Luſt muſt have exceſſive Diet to maintain it; and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pampering of the Bellie, by Drinks and Meats, doe naturally tend to concupiſcence. It is the opinion of the Greek Church, (as we read in the Councill of <hi>Florence</hi>) that the Evill and Apoſtate Spirits caſt down from their Dignity, miſſed but a little to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59605:142"/> Bodies; ſo did they degenerate upon it: and therefore ſtill covet to poſſeſſe Bodies, to this day, and to enter into Swine rather than to want materiall Habitations. Yet we never read that they delight in the bodily pleaſures that men doe offend in. No not when the Devill tempted <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to eat the forbidden fruit, doe we read that he ſo much as taſted of it himſelfe, though it might have been a notable allurement to Man ſo to doe allſo? This Sin of Gluttonie therefore is that which ſoils the Soule of Man rather than the Devill. And though we call this a beaſtly ſin, yet Beaſts exceed not ſo much therein as doth Man. But it is an unruly, and unreaſonable appetite in man, of eating and drinking: little conſidering the true uſe and ends of ſuch neceſſarie acts or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God and Nature, which are the maintenance of Being, and daylie repairing or recruiting the loſſes, the frail and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering body ſuffereth. But firſt, Men being prompted by Nature, to eat and drink, and a pleaſure being conjoyned with them, leaſt men ſhould omitt what is ſo neceſſarie, blinde and ſervile Man devotes himſelfe too often to that, which was appointed to ſerve his turne. But he that made Fountains and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of waters for the relief of our thirſt, never intended we ſhould throw our ſelves into them and be drown'd: And he who
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59605:142"/> gave man the underſtanding to invent Wines, never intended he ſhould drown himſelfe in a Butt: And he allſo that indulged to man about the ſame time, the uſe of Fleſh, as of the hearb of the Fields and roots of the Earth, and fruits of Trees, never meant we ſhould never give over inventing new Diſhes and Dainties; or be too ravenous of ſimpler Diet: but that we ſhould meaſure both quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie and quality of what we eat and drink, by the rules of Nature, his holy Word, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other circumſtances prudent Perſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant of, unleſſe they chooſe ſo to be</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For notwithſtanding it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely determined, what is the proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of every mans Bodie, no more than what proportion belongs to every mans Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which are greater or leſſer; nor how many, or what manner of Diſhes are fit for all mens Tables, yet muſt Judgment and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon direct in this caſe. The common ſaying is, That Nature is content with a little, and Religion with leſſe: yet may that Rule be queſtioned, if taken ſo looſely as generally. For when it is ſaid, Nature is content with a little, we underſtand thereby, that Nature may ſubſiſt and be preſerved with a little; but what, and how little that is, Nature hath not taught us: and I think Religion does not require we ſhould too anxiouſly inquire after: much leſſe doth it require that we
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59605:143"/> ſhould eat or drink leſſe than Nature requires. For then it ſhould require us to deſtroy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo to murther our ſelves leiſurely and ſlily, which is moſt of all forbidden by Religion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But neither here ought any man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelfe, ſo as by inconſiderate indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe Meats and Drinks in a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall quantity, kinde, or quality, contract an habit of ſo doing, which to break off, is next to deſtroying of Nature: For this acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red neceſſity being neither of Gods, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures contrivance or cauſe, is more culpable than an accidentall detriment ariſing to the body by endeavouring to reduce it to its true and priſtine State. So that the violence is not offer'd to it as corrupted or debauched, but the violence was, to corrupt it ſo, as to bring it into a neceſſity of perſiſting in exceſſe; by all meanes to be redreſſed: former wrie ſteps, and wrenchings affected, and wilfull making the following lameneſſe ſinfull, though not wilfull.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But if we judge of Natures conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe from the common cuſtome of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking to the quieting of naturall appetites; ſo indeed, Religion may be ſaid to allow leſſe than Nature. For as much as it is an act of ſelfe-deniall, to give over eating or drinking before Nature gives over craving. So that it is a ſtrange plea uſed by too many
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59605:143"/> ſoftened natures: They cannot Faſt, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed comply with the gentler and lighter Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinences ſcarce deſerving the names of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe they finde their ſtomachs call for ſupplies accuſtomed. They pretend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, they ſhall be ſick; and perhaps glorie in their infirmitie; not conſidering what a great diſparagement it is to any Chriſtian, to have ſo brought up his ſtomach, that in wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner, fed it muſt be. And perhaps in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of this unrulie appetite to alledge, <hi>God hath made all things clean, and all Meats are lawfull, being taken with thankſgiving;</hi> and ſuch like mentioned before. But ſuch as theſe ſhould doe very well to conſider, what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>All things are lawfull to me, but all things are not expedient. All things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and them.</hi> Surely, he that muſt eat in an uninterrupted courſe, hath brought himſelfe under the power or tyrannie of his belly, a very lamentable ſervitude; and not Chriſtian liberty.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This Sin of Intemperance therefore is incurred ſeverall waies, all which are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome, and by others (I know) not regarded. But the principall may be theſe, which I ſhall here rather touch than handle;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59605:144"/> having elſewhere treated on this Subject. One way of offending herein, is the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity we eat or drink: Another is the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when we are ſtudious of Delicacies and Dainties. A third way is in the manner, when with too much intention of minde and greedineſſe, we devour, rather than take our ordinary Meals: And laſtly, when we eat unſeaſonably, againſt due rule and order, and Chriſtian preſcriptions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For the Quantity, no ſet Rule can be given, but every man is to be a Law unto himſelfe, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man: For Gods Word ſo frequently enjoyning Temperance, doth committ the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation and application of that Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, as beſt able to judge (unleſſe corrupted by his Palate) his own capacitie, and the exigencie of his nature. Sexes, Ages, ſtrength, and weakneſſe of nature of divers perſons, and employments laborious and hard, or light and ſedentarie, make great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the ſtomachs and appetites of men. So that in eating, one muſt not raſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne another, becauſe he takes a greater portion than himſelfe: neither muſt he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfe from Gluttonie who eats no more than another, the cauſe making the equality Arithmeticall, unreaſonable. All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies provided and obſerved, that in eating and drinking, a man hath not by unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59605:144"/> uſances, brought upon himſelfe an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall neceſſity of taking more than his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. For in ſuch caſes, he is a glutton by vertue of his firſt errour neceſſitating the following; and reformation, if not ſuddenly, yet gradually muſt be made by a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian according to the auncienter and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner Rule of uſing Gods creatures to Gods glory, and Natures benefit.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And for the Qualitie, the ſimpler and more naturall, the better it muſt needs be; the great naturall ends of ſuſtenance, and healthfulneſſe, and uſefulneſſe to bodye and minde, which moderately conſidered are ſtrong, luſtie, expedite, and active, but tainted with the inventions of Kitchin Philoſophers, are enfeebled and confounded: And the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the delicious Palate becomes ſo reſtleſſe and unſatisfied, that the greateſt wits in that Trade can ſcarce finde out Novelties faſt enough to ſtill them. No, though there be ſuch encouragements to advance Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that greaſie black Art, that ſome great Perſons have doubled the Salarie of their Cooks, to that of their Chaplains; So baſe an Object was a Cook aunciently amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Livie</hi> tells us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 39. that none was his equall in vileneſſe, untill true Maſculineſſe decayed in <hi>Rome:</hi> and the Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Armie having ſubdued thoſe Countries, brought home the infection of deliciouſneſſe
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59605:145"/> in Diet, which made Cookery a noble Science at length; which before was a drudgerie few would be hired to. But how much more ſhamefull and lamentable is it, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and Nobilitie too, (ſome of them) ſhould look upon it as a piece of forrein breeding, to underſtand how to make palatable Sauces, and in perſon to practiſe ſuch ignoble and degenerous acts: whereas, if their Tutours the <hi>French,</hi> had taught them to mend their old Clothes and Shoes, they had brought back a more uſefull, and no leſſe commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Art; though they were as learned in that Art of Cookery as was <hi>Suitrigall</hi> Duke of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> who (as <hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> tells us) wrote an accurate book of Cookerie; which, wherever he travailed, he would be ſure to give ſtrict charge to his Steward to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to bring along with him. What is this but to fall juſtly under Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Cenſure, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their bellie, who minde earthly things.</hi> For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>They that are ſuch ſerve not the Lord Jeſus, but their own bellies.</hi> Both which, <hi>i. e.</hi> Idoll and Idolater, God ſhall deſtroy; nay themſelves haſten to deſtruction by ſuch indulgence, and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. And the reaſon holds againſt drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eating with affectation and pleaſure more than naturall. For both make up Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie: and ſometimes, one.</p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59605:145"/>
                  <p n="9">9. A third kinde is the inordinate manner of eating: when men, with too much greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and haſt, devour rather than eat their Meat: and ſo become rude and ſcandalous, and injurious to Nature it ſelfe, not able to diſpatch ſo ſuddainly, what is ſtuffed in ſo hudlingly; to the prejudice of the body. And, which is a great diſappointment, the Appetite is oppreſſed, rather than ſatisfied. But it is far from my purpoſe, to inſinuate any thing here which may inſtruct men to eat or drink to the beſt advantage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Laſtly, The offence in unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eating and drinking, were here to be explained, had I not in the directions above given for the cuſtodie of the outward man, treated of Faſting, and the obligation Chriſtians have, not allwayes, to meaſure their libertie herein by the generall natures of Meats and Drinkes, nor by their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites diſpoſing them ſo to doe, againſt lawfull reſtraint and order. For ſuch muſt either be rebellious in their mindes againſt Lawfull Autority, or gluttonous in their luſtfull part, who contemne all regulations not of their own deviſing in this caſe. Whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle plainly tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>All things are indeed pure, but it is evill with that man who eateth with offence:</hi> Offence then, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the contumacious deſpiſing of Autority
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59605:146"/> undoubted, converteth clean Meats into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; and ſtands in need of this Purgative Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as much as immoderate Gormandizing.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The meanes of curing this Diſtemper have been, ſome of them, touched before, and therefore now this Summary may ſuffice. Firſt, Gluttonie comprehending eating and drinking both, is a waſting the Spirits or oppreſſing of the minde, the fountain of true ingeniouſneſſe and Reaſon. 2. It weakens the bodie allſo, as well as the minde; and that Politick, as well as Perſonall; men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by being effeminated, unhardy, dull, and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but when the phrenzie of exceſſe heats their brain; when they ſhould be ſobereſt and wiſeſt, they become brutiſh. 3. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of precious hours; to trample upon which, they chooſe ſuch diverſions, more truely called, ſubverſions of themſelves: and 4. Of the good creatures which God having ordained to be received with thankſgiving and bleſſing him, are turned to his diſhonour, by riotouſneſſe, curſing and ſwearing, and blaſpheming, and contentions, and mutuall violences and aſſaſſinations. 5. Hereby Men (and Women too of this order) are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unlawfull luſts of the fleſh: and what not, but Modeſtie, Humility, Chaſtitie, Mercifull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the poor, and divine Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which will not down with the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous, nor riſe high with the Drunkard.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59605:146"/> And above all, to avoid this Rock, ſteer we our courſe by the due Compaſſes of Gods holy Word, which <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. adviſeth, <hi>Let us walk honeſtly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſſe, not in chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, not in ſtrife and envie; But put on the Lord Jeſus, and make no proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein is exceſſe, but be filled with the Spirit.</hi> And let that premonition ſink into our hearts, given by Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſſe, and cares of this life; and ſo that day come upon you unawares.</hi> For as our Saviour ſaith allſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>If that ſervant ſay in his heart, My Lord deferreth his coming, and ſhall begin to beat the Men-ſervants and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and to eat and to drink, and to be drunken; the Lord of that ſervant will come in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in an hour, when he is not aware; and will cut him in ſunder, and will appoint him his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers.</hi> And the wiſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant will not ſay within himſelfe, My Lord deferreth his coming, underſtanding this to be ſpoken only of the coming of Chriſt at the laſt and generall Judgement, but of his particular Domes-day; when his life ſhall be called for by God, and his own beloved ſin of exceſſe

How many Tragicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances doth our Age afford of ſuch who have been confounded in their own ſin, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in this pleaſure? I ſhall need to name none of yeſterday, or of this Nation: I would it were not notorious. But two moſt eminent and mighty Potentates I may mention, I hope without offence, and not without ſenſe, or ſome effect. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great his Friends and Flatterers write that he died of Poiſon given him at <hi>Babylon:</hi> but others more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere tellers of Trueth write that Wine, was that Poiſon exceſſively taken, and that Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe kill'd him, as may be ſeen in <hi>Seneca, Epiſt.</hi> 58. And who ſo great a Man in his dayes, and ſo victorious as <hi>Attilas?</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his many Conqueſts, not being able to overcome his Appetite of Wine, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by it to that degree one day, that he was taken ſo ill the next night, that he void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blood at his Mouth, and ſo died choaked with it; As <hi>Munſter</hi> tells us in his <hi>Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie.</hi> Let theſe things then ſink into <hi>our hearts,</hi> and have ſuch influence upon our lives and manners as to prevent ſuch diſorders and miſcarriages. And let all they whoſe faith is dim-ſighted or weak, as to have no power over them in declaring to them and convincing them of the defilements of their Soules contracted by theſe exceſſes and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59605:147"/> ſpewings on their own glorie, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> aptly expreſſes it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 16. be taught, at length, and convinced by their ſenſes and common experience; what a ſtain to their Name, what a wound to their Bodie, they bring, from which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be purged, or of which cured but by Tears of timely Repentance, and the happie change of due Renovation: both which will be ſo much the more difficult, by how much they are more deferred.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XVII. Of Slothfullneſſe, the laſt Capitall Sin.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. SLothfulneſſe and affected dulneſſe of Minde and lazineſſe of Bodie is not denied to be a Sin by any; but to many, ſeems ſo modeſt, innocent, and harmleſſe, that they wonder why it ſhould be ranked amongſt the moſt dangerous and deadly: But, as we before obſerved, Sins are not to be eſtimated from their intrinſick or abſolute evill only, but allſo from the tayle they draw after them, and the brood iſſuing from them. And thus Slothfullneſſe may be inferiour in conſequentiall miſchiefs, to none. For this numneſſe of minde and indiſpoſition of bodie to act, extendeth it ſelfe equally to both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59605:148"/> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> Naturall; and Divine, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; it being ſeldome known, that he, whoſe minde is dull'd by indulging to eaſe, is active any wayes in Religion. And in trueth, ſo notorious is it, that Divines treat of it onely, or chiefly as to Religion, which it corrupteth, if not totally deſtroyeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For as Labour and honeſt induſtry ſeems to be the firſt Vertue inſinuated in Scripture and appointed to Man, ſo may the Vice of Sloth be the very firſt of practicall Errours, ſuppoſing that Pride was the firſt of Mentall Vices. For we read <hi>Geneſis,</hi> Chap. 2. that there was at firſt no man to till the ground, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and we read, <hi>v.</hi> 8. That God made man ſo ſoon as he had made <hi>Eden,</hi> and put him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ſurely not to be idle, leſt the Earth ſhould be idle too: ſo that Action, was a Vertue of Paradiſe. And ſo it was afterward, when man turned out from thence, was to make a Vertue of neceſſity; and work, to keep him from adding ſin unto ſin, and calamitie unto calamitie. For as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> well obſerves, it was an act of Goodneſſe in God to turne fallen man out of Paradiſe, to the wide world: and a bleſſing to him, to curſe the Land, ſo that without hard labour, he could not well ſubſiſt. For if when Man was maſter of ſo much Reaſon, and owner of ſo much Grace given him of God, he fell into temptations, and from thence into ſin; who can imagine
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59605:148"/> but deſtitute in great meaſure of ſuch aids and abilities, he ſhould riot unmeaſurably, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in eaſe, plenty, ſpontaneous, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive reſt; odious, and dangerous.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And therefore though my purpoſe be to oppoſe Sloth as it relates to Religion, the Connexion being ſo neer and ſtrait between diligence in humane and divine Affairs, it is neceſſarie to declare the ſinfullneſſe and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and to correct the pravitie of the firſt, before we can expect any good event in the latter. For a ſoft, heavie temper is the originall of both; and a ſickleneſſe, and wearineſſe in doing any thing long, or of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie; but a certain ſpiritleſſe loying, and lying ſtill; or, as the ſaying is, Wandering up and down to ſee who does nothing, and help them: untill all meanes uſed to gratifie fleſh and blood, and none ſufficing, idleneſſe proves more tedious and tireſome than labour to others: And none groan under the burden and heat and length of the day by labouring, ſo much as the ſlothfull and idle perſon doth under void time, and emptie hours. And none brings more diſtempers upon his bodie, by working, nor ſo many, as the Sluggard by doing nothing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But doe I ſay or ſuppoſe that a man awake, and well in his witts, and limbes, can reſt in the Negative, doing nothing? it is hard to be believed. The Devill will not ſuffer his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59605:149"/> Soule to be as <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Underſtanding of Infants, <hi>Raſa Tabula,</hi> a ſmooth and eaven Table, or as white Paper, in which nothing is writ, but is capable of any ſtamp or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion it pleaſes the ſtander by to make in it: but he will write his minde in it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. This is, ſaith <hi>Caſſian, Collat.</hi> 10. the judgement of the Monaſtique Fathers of old in <hi>Egypt:</hi> that the induſtrious Monk is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted with one Devill, but the idle, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable. So that as the ſame Author there allſo tells; it was the cuſtome of Abbot <hi>Paul</hi> (to avoid idleneſſe) to burne thoſe effects of his labours which were more than ſufficient to bring in a bare livelihood, that he might never want work, or become idle.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And this he might learn of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. 11. who teaches us the dependence ſecular labour, in an honeſt way, hath upon Religion, and on the contrary, ſaying, <hi>Not ſlothfull in buſineſſe, fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Diligence here in buſineſſe is ſet before Fervour in Spirit, and in the ſervice of God; intimating the uſefulneſſe of bodily labour, in diſpoſing to Divine: Not that all who are ardent purſuers of the world, are proportionably induſtrious for Heaven; but that they whoſe Genius indiſpoſes them to the one, ſeldome ſhew any ſpirit or liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the other. For often it happens
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59605:149"/> that immoderate care of Earth, ſtupifies the ſenſe a man ought to have of Heaven. But if there be no fire on the Smiths Forge, no work good or bad can be wrought there. So that as <hi>Siracides</hi> ſaith, Chap. 22. 1, 2. <hi>A ſlothfull man is compared to a filthy ſtone, and every one will hiſſe him out to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. A ſlothfull man is compared to the filth of a Dunghill, every man that taketh it up will ſhake his hand.</hi> And moderner Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of the <hi>Jewes</hi> give this for a Rule, <hi>Whoſoever bringeth up his Son to no employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, teaches him to turne Robber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. But to come cloſer up to the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cure of ſpirituall Sloth. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ground of lazineſſe laid, where Nature admoniſhes to be ſtirring; no wonder the Spirits faile a man in things above, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt Nature. For this indiſpoſition to Good ſeizes firſt the minde, ſadding it at the approaching good Duties: that they muſt riſe from their ſeat or Bed; that they muſt ſpend ſo much time about the dry ſervice of their Souls. And though in their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs perhaps, ſinfully ſlothfull, yet when ſuch expectation is of them, that ſerve God, they muſt, and ought, they will forget their lazineſſe in worldly matters, and be ſtirring then and there, when for ſhame they muſt doe ſomething. Then ſhall Civility in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or entertaining a Friend, be alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59605:150"/> the tedious hour or two in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Nay perhaps, Charitie to viſit the ſick juſt at that time, ſhall be pretended; and Scripture ſometimes ſhall be alledged as war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting not too raſh and unprepar'd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to ſacred Offices; when the reall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, ſpirituall ſloth detaining them from preparing themſelves, and averſeneſſe to Good. Which lothneſſe to open the mouth, or bend the knee, or raiſe the bodie anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the exigence of the ſeverall parts of Gods publique Worſhip amongſt manie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from dead-heartedneſſe in Religion, and to hide or excuſe that, perhaps a reaſon taken from Religion, ſhall be forged; and Conſcience ſhall be alledged, and ſimplicitie of Evangelicall worſhip, and the ſtraiteſt way of going to Chriſt, ſhall be offer'd; contrarie to the generall practice of the Catholique Churches, in the beſt Ages; and all this while, liſtleſſneſſe in the ſervice of God is at the bottome of all: though I know religious, or more properly, ſuperſtitious Paradoxes have of late obſtructed divers in this way: under whoſe protection, ſlothfullneſſe too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhelters it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Neither doth the ſlothfull Soule carrie it ſelfe with ſo much ofcitancie in things made doubtfull by the cunning ſleights of men, whereby they lye in wait to diſturb Religion, and deſtroy Charity, but in things out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59605:150"/> allſo: as when men read the Scriptures, or hear godlie Doctrine, and Precepts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attention; pray without zeal and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpirit, Sing without cheerfullneſſe and elevation of minde; live without circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; confeſſe their ſins without ſorrow and contrition. So that the hedge of vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance being broken down, all they that paſſe by (all ſorts of temptations) as <hi>Pſalme</hi> 80. hath it, pluck her: <hi>the Boar out of the wood waſts it, and the wild Beaſt of the field devours it.</hi> For hereby is it made, as it were, a thorow-fare for all ſorts of tempting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. So that, to this, and not to ill-husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, may we believe <hi>Solomon</hi> to have reſpect, when he ſaith, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 24. 30, 31. <hi>I went by the field of the ſlothfull, and by the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the man void of underſtanding: and it was all grown over with Thornes, and Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles had covered the face thereof; and the Stone-wall thereof was broken down:</hi> whereby is inſinuated the deſolations of the Soule occaſioned by ſpirituall careleſneſſe and ſloth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Yet am I not ſo ſevere as to impute to this Vice, all the defects we are ſubject to here in ſpirituall things: For not without Gods ſpeciall permiſſion, it happens divers times that faithfull and righteous Soules are ſurpriſed with dullneſſe, and aridities in Gods ſervice. But not in the like manner; For in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59605:151"/> the Soule tainted with the vice of Sloth, no great trouble or ſollicitude befalls the ſame, but it paſſes the thing over unconcerned; implying ſtrongly an affectedneſſe in the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage: whereas in the Spirit becalmed, as it were, for want of the Spirit of Grace, great anxiety and diſcontent affect it; like as the Ship having loſt the Winde, lyeth beating her ſelfe with her Sails. But they who by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Dutie, or ſpeciall Offices, eſpecially Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Sacred, ſuſpend themſelves ſtudiouſly from diſcharging them painfully and diligently, becauſe they can live at eaſe and ſit ſtill, and perhaps have ſome other to toyl for them, let them at leaſt labour hard to bring themſelves off from this imputation of ſloth, for I cannot: neither muſt I accuſe them according to their merits.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And to the intent we may better quitt our ſelves of this burden, let us ſee briefly, what may be preſcribed againſt it. Firſt then, let us look up, and lift up a Prayer unto the Authour of all Graces, to ſend this Grace unto us. For he hath promiſed what we ask in his Name, and, with great confidence we hope, for his ſervice, he will grant us: as he did unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> requeſting, what might make him more ſerviceable in the place to which he was by God, called.</p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:59605:151"/>
                  <p n="10">10. Another Remedie and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, is the conſideration of the unſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire fleſh and blood have of Eaſe, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, contrary to divine Exerciſes: ſo that yield to them, they become ſofter and ſofter, duller and duller: lother and lother to engage in religious actions, untill eaſie things become difficult; and difficult things left quite off; and a deſolation be made in the Soule: ſo that a man may ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. <hi>My ſoule melteth away for very heavineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Nay, Thirdly, Contrarie Maladies will multiply and grow ſtrong againſt the Soule, anſwerable to the deſcription given by ſome of ſpirituall ſloth, <hi>viz. A grief and ſorrow of heart at the apprehenſion of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exerciſes approaching:</hi> ſuch as are Puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity ſpirituall, affraid of every inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; weariſomneſſe under the accuſtomed and halfe-conſtrained perfourmances, though not frequent; deſpondencie, and diffidence of any good to come of ſuch things; and thereupon, arguing againſt the troubleſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, ſomnolencie in them, and gladneſſe when delivered out of them: after the manner of the corrupt <hi>Jewes,</hi> Amos 8. 5. <hi>When will the new Moon, and Sabbath be over?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. Furthermore, it may avail much, to conſider ſeriouſly what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 9. <hi>He that is ſlothfull in his work is Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him that is a great waſter.</hi> For like
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59605:152"/> a City without a Watch or Walls, he lyeth expoſed to all Invaders, and ſpoilers. And that good which he doth is thereby corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his time, and pains little better than loſt; and God provoked to reject his maimed and lame ſacrifice. For as it is uſually ſaid, A cold Praiſe tends to a diſparagement; ſo a cold Prayer tends much to a deniall. It is the effectuall fervent prayer of the <hi>Righteous that availeth much,</hi> as Saint <hi>James</hi> teaches us. And ſo by the Rule of contraries; It is the ſlothfull and cold Prayer that prevaileth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or very little.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And therefore fifthly, to quit our ſelves of this ſtupidneſſe of ſpirit, it will be neceſſary to take that contrary and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Vertue of Chriſtian fortitude, unto us; ſo rare, and yet ſo uſefull againſt the many temptations offered to us in this world: and to be cloathed with zeal as with a cloak, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 59. 17. For were not it for the carnall baſhfullneſſe that many men ſhow in the cauſe of Religion and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, ſhrinking for fear of the Enemies to it, and that without cauſe; Enemies to godly life would not be ſo audacious as they are: but by the cowardiſe of the well-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled and inclined, a Conqueſt ſeems to have been made by the adverſe partie over the Religious; which conſent and courage may eaſily undoe. And not only the openly
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59605:152"/> irreligious have brought under too much the profeſſion of the truely religious; but the audaciouſneſſe of men of erroneous Religion hath gain'd them reſpect, when their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practice deſerved nothing leſſe. Yea it is to be lamented, to conſider, that Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Perſons having with wonderfull confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence uſurped to themſelves the advantages of ſober and preciſe behaviour; and many excellent Phraſes of Holy Scripture, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication becoming the mouths of better Chriſtians, divers have been ſo ſcandalized at the ill uſe of them by ſuch, (which in trueth hath been notorious) that they can hardly finde in their heart, or frame their mouths to ſuch wholeſome formes of words, (which are an Ornament to the mouth of a good Chriſtian) ſo perverted by others. It was the compariſon indeed of a religious Perſon living an Age or two ſince, Whoe would not loth to eat an Apple, before knawn by a Swine? ſo who will not ſhrink to take that Phraſe into his mouth, which has been abuſed by polluted mouths and to ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ends. But as they who ſhoot at God, hurt not him, but wound themſelves, ſo they who are vulgarly ſaid to corrupt, and abuſe the Scriptures and its holy Dialect, to their own purpoſes, doe not in very deed defile and abuſe that, which, like God the Authour, changes not, but remains the ſame, but they
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59605:153"/> pollute and wrong themſelves. For, as the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> ſpeaketh, Chap. 1. 15. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled, is nothing pure, but even their minde and conſcience is defiled.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying aſide that vain and fearfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie which is ſo near a-kin to the ſin of <hi>Acedia,</hi> (as the Greek word is, and more comprehenſively; which we may render, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiouſneſſe, or Oſcitancie, or indiſpoſedneſſe to Good,) <hi>Let us, Brethren</hi> (as Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words are, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.) <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might:</hi> and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and vitious men, their own Conſcience bearing witneſſe againſt them, will become timorous and aſhamed. For as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 13. <hi>It is the ſlothfull man that ſaith, There is a Lion in the way:</hi> that is, great dangers and many difficulties in the ſtricter and more faithfull ſervice of God; but the more reſolute and diligent finde it not ſo, but that the Yoke of Chriſt is eaſie, and his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light, and that there is reſt for the Soule; as himſelfe hath ſaid.</p>

                  <head>SECT. XVIII. The Concluſion of this Second Part; with ſome ſhort advices relating to what hath been ſaid therein.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. HAving thus treated of the neceſſity and manner of ſupernaturall Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and Purgation tending to ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Union with God; we hold it fit to cloſe this Part with the offering of ſome brief Rules for the better directing of ſuch who ſhall be inclined to improve farther, what hath been ſaid before, concerning the purification and preparation of the Soule for a nerer conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with God, by ſubduing that Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Dragon, in the ſeven Capitall Sins; or thoſe ſeven Devills, like to them which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Mary Magdalene;</hi> and which are as the ſeven Hills upon which the Antichriſt every one carries about him, ſitteth, and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth over the Soule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Firſt, That becauſe we are all borne in ſin, and even after we are regenerate in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, doe, through the infirmitie of the fleſh, fall commonly into ſin, that no man therefore allowe in himſelfe any known ſin whether light, or heavie; for hereby what was but a ſin of infirmity, becomes a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſin, and ſo is accounted by God.</p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:59605:154"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Secondly, Some ſins of both ranks are with more ſpeciall care to be attended to and oppoſed by us. And ſuch I am wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which our Parents, from whome we are immediately deſcended, were ſubject to, more than others; or they who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before them. For undoubted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth us, that not onely what we call <hi>Originall Sin,</hi> but ſuch actuall ſin as hath ſtrongly poſſeſſed them, is often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Children, together with the temper of their bodies. And allſo thoſe ſins or failings in Parents and others which have been Examples to us in our minority and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, are to be ſuſpected and feared by us. Conſtant Examples of evill, even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved in others, too often having a great power over us, when (eſpecially) we are brought into the like circumſtances, and the ſame occaſions are offered us of offending, as was to them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thirdly, Great inſpection and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is to be had by every man of his own conſtitution or naturall complexion: For as that Great Phyſician ſaid, Mens manners doe generally follow their humours abounding in them (and therefore we commonly call the frequenter and conſtanter extravagancies of men, their humours,) ſo that ſome are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned naturally to Choler or Anger, others to Jocundneſſe and Levitie; others to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59605:154"/> and dullneſſe, &amp;c. Which a wiſe man and good Chriſtian reflecting upon, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning in himſelfe, ought to apply a proper Remedie unto, and more watchfully to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the evill events of them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fourthly, A ſtrong hand is to be carried againſt the powerfull and violent temptation of Faſhion, when it becomes Noble, Gallant, or Great, (as vain perſons ſometimes ſpeak) againſt Modeſty, Sobriety, Temperance, or Continence: For ſuch, many are; as muſt be acknowledged more eſpecially in diverſitie of Sexes, which Nature hath made: and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of Politicall, and Eccleſiaſticall Orders which God hath made; And therefore are wiſely and juſtly diſtinguiſhed by beſt Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: So that by no better arguments can any man defend indifferencie of Habits and outward deportment of the Laiety and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, than will equally ſerve for the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie of the ſame to both Sexes. For what is ſaid againſt it by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be eluded by reducing it to a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall or judiciall Law.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Fifthly, To rebuke, repreſſe, or expell ſinfull inclinations in our ſelves, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that we ſhould not reſt in the opinion we have of our ſelves: which is commonly biaſſed by ſelfe-conceit, ſelfe-love, ſelfe-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, all quite contrary to that great Dutie of Selfe-deniall; but that we ſhould be ſo
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59605:155"/> true and juſt to our own Soules, as like righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judges, to keep one Ear for what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judge of us, and impartially to give a ſentence upon our ſelves accordingly, and not ſlie to that baſe and bold ſubterfuge of nonplus'd and ſhameleſſe perſons, <hi>I care not, I care not.</hi> For though Malice and ill-will may inſtigate ſome one or two, and upon ſpeciall occaſion, to falſe accuſations and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; yet if the opinion be of more, and thoſe not ſo prejudiced; and conſtant, and laſting, in vain doe men proclaim their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and innocencie; for ſuch judgement of others is much more to be truſted than our own.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Sixthly, Appearance of Evill, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie reverſt (as I may ſo ſpeak) when men ſeem by outward carriage to be worſe than in trueth they are, is allſo carefully to be avoided, not onely becauſe of the ſin of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing our Brethren and cauſing an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous judgement and uncharitable to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained; but becauſe it very often happens, that men fall really into that ſin which they at firſt onely ſeemed to committ. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rule, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man allſo on the things of others:</hi> not by curioſitie and cenſoriouſneſſe, but Charitie and conſcienti ous walking without offence to others; and if poſſible, to prevent ſin in others as well as our ſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:59605:155"/>
                  <p n="8">8. Laſtly, Every man ſhould have Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie towards his Brother, but no man is to demean himſelfe ſo as to ſtand in need of the charitable judgement of others. For he that doth ſo, is certainly uncharitable in the firſt place: and being really guiltie within himſelfe, is moſt wickedly unjuſt in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that another ſhould be ſo charitable as not to think ſo of him: though there be uſe of Charitie, even where Crimes are paſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or excuſes: but for men to live conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves of unrighteouſneſs towards God, and juſtice towards men, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there may want notorious convictions to demand of Cenſurers to judge charitably, is in effect, to require that others ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and they may be wicked, under the protection of others Pietie, and Charitie.</p>

                  <p>O Lord God, who is like unto thee amongſt the Gods? Who is like unto thee, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in holineſſe, fearfull in praiſes, doing wonders? And what greater wonder is there than of ſons of Men we ſhould be called the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59605:156"/> Sons of God? and of Children of wrath, heirs of the Kingdome of God: of loſt ſheep, be brought back to the great Shepheard of our Soules: of prodigall and fugitive Sons, be brought home, and embraced by thee our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father: making us as well as requiring us to be holy as thou art holy, raiſing us from the death of ſin to the life of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, given us by the Spirit of Grace, which worketh in us by the meanes of Grace ordained by thee to that great end. Let that Spirit be never wanting in me, let that Grace never be received by me in vain, whereby I may be ſenſible of my unworthineſſe, and inſufficiencie to any thing that is good; and at leaſt to have an hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, that I may, in thy due time be ſatisfied: and in the mean time grow and increaſe in this deſire, and this deſire proceed to action, and this action to ſuch perfection as to overcome and mortifie all worldly luſts, and Carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, purifying my ſelfe as he is pure; and taking greater content and pleaſure in caſting off, than ever I did in taking on me the burden of ſin; and in purging away all my old ſin, than ever I did in contracting thoſe ſpots and blemiſhes which have too much, and too long defiled that pure Spirit thou once gaveſt me; and defaced that beautifull Image thou once ſtampedſt on me. And let the pleaſure of Repenting be greater to me,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59605:156"/> than that of offending ever was to me, though (alas!) it was too great. Lord, nothing is impoſſible to thee, who canſt bring light out of darkneſſe, and ſtrength out of weakneſſe, and out of ſtones raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and to thy ſelfe: and out of the ruines of Religion in me, raiſe up a Temple fit for thy holy Spirit to dwell in. Deſcend into, poſſeſſe, and dwell in my heart by faith, and love of thee: which may purge out the old leaven, and make me a new lump; and quench all fleſhly Concupiſcences which have, or may raign over me, or rage in me. For this corruptible bodie preſſeth down my minde muſing on high and heavenly things, and the weight of ſin ſo eaſily beſetteth me, that I cannot run the Race which is ſet before me, and the ſtain of ſin pollutes my beſt actions: Wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from this bodie of death, from this bondage of corruption? Thy grace, I know, O Lord, is ſufficient for me, and thy Son mighty to ſave, and that his Office is to ſave his people from their ſins, from their ſins, I ſay, as well as from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin; Let that Day-ſtar at length ariſe in my heart and enlighten and warm my minde with love of thee, and let that breath of new life be inſpired into me, enliven my dead bodie, and re unite and animate my drie bones, and excite me with new vigour to the perfourming thy holy will: that ſo the life
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59605:157"/> I now live may be by the faith of the Son of God: and being poor in ſpirit as he was, I may be pure in ſpirit as he allſo was, for theirs is the Kingdome of God, even the Kingdome of Grace here, and the Kingdome of Glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whither, O mercifull God and Father, in thy due time bring me, for thy bleſſed Sons ſake Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. SUCH due preparation being made towards Spirituall Life, in laying aſide every ſin ſo eaſily beſetting us, the remainder of our Chriſtian Race to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and our Union with him are more eaſily attained: which Union is by Saint <hi>John,</hi> called, <hi>our fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59605:158"/> and the Son,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. And this is it which vulgarly is called allſo, <hi>Perfection:</hi> Perfection being here uſed for Juſtification by faith in Chriſt: and Chriſt dwelling in us, and ſuch a meaſure of aſſurance of Gods grace and favour which are competible to our Militant ſtate in this life, and incline God to the acceptation of us to a future inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Immortalitie and Glorie. And to this, it is not abſolutely neceſſarie that no blemiſh, imperfection or infirmity ſhould be incident; but that none ſuch ſhould be found, which either of it ſelfe ſhould tend to corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, or deſerve amputation from the Body of Chriſt, of which, ſuch perfection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction make us members.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus far onely, if the phanaticall ſtrains found in Myſticall Theologie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie Extremes, had proceeded, not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie but honour allſo had been due unto it. But we finde the Moderne advancers of it, to have ſcandalouſly corrupted it, by affectation of exceſſes in Stile and big Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and facts agreeable to them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> writing on that Subject, thus ſimply deſcribes it, in his Prologue to it. It is the extenſion of love towards God, by the deſire of love. And a little after he ſaith, It is ſuch, whereby the religious Soule leaving humane Wiſdome, the curiouſneſſe of unprofitable knowledge, and the ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59605:158"/> of argumentations and Opinions, by the Aſcent of love riſes up to the Fountain of all, by deſiring, in which onely ſhe finds trueth: inſomuch that the ſimple Laick being in the School of God, may receive this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from God himſelfe immediately, by the affection of love; which no naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, nor ſecular Maſter, nor humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, can attain to. Neither is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this Unitive Way given by <hi>Gerſon</hi> in his <hi>Myſticall Theologie;</hi> to be rejected; where, more ſoberly than divers of late dayes affect to ſpeak; He ſaith, Myſticall Divinitie is an experimentall Knowledge had of God, by the conjunction with God by ſpirituall affection. But we cannot allow of ſuch great ſwelling words, and ecſtaticall practices an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable thereunto, wrapping mens Soules in a Cloud of reall Ignorance, in the midſt of their purſuit of ſupreame Knowledge; and ſuffering them to fall into direct profaneneſſe of words and deeds, while they have a ſtrong and vain emulation and affectation of ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt Devotion, and Pietie: which, to paſſe over the many exorbitancies in this kinde, found amongſt ſuch as are known by the name of <hi>Phanatiques,</hi> a great pretender to Devotion, <hi>Horſtius</hi> in a <hi>Latine</hi> Book, which he calls <hi>The Paradiſe of the Soule,</hi> hath fallen into, there ſpeaking in this manner, <hi>pag.</hi> 59. <hi>Trulie Lord, if what is not poſſible, I were
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59605:159"/> owner of any thing which thou wantedſt, I would willingly yield all to thee, and give it thee. Yea, if I could be God, I would not, for this onely, that thou mighteſt be God and have no Peer.</hi> Which, with us, is no better than a piece of fond Devotion, and implicite Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, proceeding from an illimited affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrange and monſtrous expreſſions, familiar with ſuch like Myſticall Divines; carefully to be avoided and ſhunned, as the bane of true and favourie Religion towards God: whereby the Devill ſets Chriſtians, as once he did Chriſt, on the Pinacle (as it were) of the Temple, that he may the more eaſily caſt them down headlong. But the heart of a true Believer being well-grounded in Faith, and ſetled in love to God, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſome ſingular and extraordinarie ſenſe of Gods goodneſſe, and the wiſdome which cometh from above, with a true ſpirituall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour towards God, and deſire of Union with him: which may be ſaid to conſiſt in theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A Cleereneſſe, then Soundneſſe; laſtly, Acquieſcence in the Will and Wayes of God. Whereby the Soule having, in ſome competent manner, <hi>eſcaped the pollutions of the world,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. cleaveth ſo ſtedfaſtly to the Lord, or <hi>is joyned</hi> to him, as it is, 1 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi> 6. 17. that it becomes one Spirit; not by tranſmutation of nature or ſubſtance, but
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59605:159"/> by aſſimilation in Holineſſe, and plenarie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the will of Man to the Will of God: that ſo God <hi>may be all in all.</hi> Which is more corporally expreſſed by Saint <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 5. where he ſaith of true Believers, <hi>We are members of his Bodie, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones:</hi> Not by tranſubſtantiation of Natures, but transformation and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the minde: as is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. So that, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 20. The life which a Chriſtian ſo transformed out of himſelfe, and conformed unto Chriſt, liveth, he liveth not; <hi>but Chriſt liveth in him,</hi> by the faith and love of Chriſt: a ſtate of Grace bordering nere upon Glory it ſelfe. In which Myſticall Language, great care is to be uſed, leaſt a Believer be ſo far drawn away from the ſolid foundation and edifying knowledge, that his Religion ſhould end in aery ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and notions; and theſe in bold deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations given himſelfe. And laſtly, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life or walking with God, as did <hi>Enoch,</hi> untill a tranſlation be made from hence, nerer to the preſence and fruition of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore, to prevent Deluſions inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to high flyers in Divinitie in this kinde, Our ſpeculations muſt be meaſured by our love to God reciprocated upon the ſenſe of Gods love, wherewith he firſt loved us: And leſt, even this love ſhould prove a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the ſincerity of it is to be proved by
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59605:160"/> the practice of a mans life, anſwering in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and degree, the fervour pretended of love: Not denying that where ſuch inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conjunction there is between God and the Soule, certain tacite and inward ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures thereof are made to it, inviſible to the world; and ſenſible only to its ſelfe; but not ſo, as therein to acquieſce without all ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude: as if ſuch were allreadie in Heaven; but with conſtant contentions about theſe two principall Points.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Firſt, How they ſhould continue in that good ſtate to which they have allreadie attained: which is no otherwiſe brought to paſſe than by the meanes whereby it was attained; as naturall Bodies ſubſiſt by the ſame Elements of which they doe conſiſt. And ſecondly, becauſe to reſt ſatisfied with what a man hath without deſigne held up of proceeding, is the next way to loſe what he hath, and to fall backward, and to decay. It is neceſſary ever to be preſſing forward, that the Tide may allwayes be riſing in grace, leaſt upon willfull remiſſion and ſlackneſſe, the Soule be, by degrees, left emptie and dry. For it is the Character of Heaven gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Saint <hi>John, Revelat.</hi> 14. <hi>That they reſt from their labours:</hi> which belongs not to any, (not the higheſt) in this life, that they ſhould ceaſe to doe good, untill that Sabbath above ſhall be enter'd into, and celebrated.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59605:160"/> And yet even of the bleſſed, there, we read, <hi>Revelat.</hi> 4. 8. That <hi>they reſt not day and night,</hi> to act according to that ſtate, where there is Union with God indiſſoluble, and Communion to ſatiety, without ſurfeit on one hand, or wearineſſe on the other. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance whereof is to be obtained even in this life by thoſe who by diligent attendance on ſpirituall Duties here, and denying the world, doe (as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hom.</hi> 34. on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpells) burne with the flames of lofty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation breathing onely with deſire of their Creatour, and coveting nothing farther in this world, are nouriſhed with the ſole love of Eternitie. They contemne all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and in their mindes tranſcend all temporary things. They love and burne: and in that heat they reſt quiet: they burne by loving, and by their ſpeech inflame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers allſo: and whome by their words they touch they inſtantly cauſe to burne with the love of God. Why therefore may I not call ſuch as theſe <hi>Seraphims,</hi> whoſe hearts are converted into fire, ſhining and burning, and withall illuminating the eyes of mens mindes unto heavenly things, and pricking them with tears, purge away the ruſt of Vices. This in ſum may be ſaid to be the more perfect ſtate of the Soule here united unto God: of which we are now more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to treat.</p>

It ſufficing that as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there ſaith, <hi>Great is the Myſterie:</hi> and that great Myſteries are not too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to be enquired into, but believed firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with endeavours to attain the ſame; which endeavours muſt be grounded upon the proper meanes conducing thereunto;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59605:161"/> which moſt of all deſerve here to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of theſe then, the preſent knowledge of God, according to humane capacitie, muſt needs be the firſt ſtep; and that not a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of humane Science, but rather of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith and experience: which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 14. moſt aptly and ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calleth, the <hi>ſavour of the knowledge of God,</hi> not onely informing, but affecting us, as it were, ſenſibly, or experimentally.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Upon this good beginning is built the deſire of God, as of the moſt excellent, glorious, and good object of all; that being fullfilled which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath, Chap. 26. 8. <hi>Yea in the way of thy judgements, O Lord, have we waited for thee: the deſire of our Soule is to thy Name, and to the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thee.</hi> For in trueth, God is in himſelfe the moſt deſireable of all things, as he is the chiefeſt good of all things, and of whoſe fullneſſe in that kinde, all things that are good, doe partake and become good. So that as it is impoſſible any thing ſhould be form'd really good but what is really, and more perfectly ſuch in him; ſo can we deſire nothing but what is moſt abſolutely and perfectly to be had in, and with him: So that, according to the illumination of the underſtanding concerning God and things Divine, will follow an appetite of the will
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59605:162"/> affected therewith. For naturall Philoſophie teaches truely, than man hath not Free-will in chooſing that which is chiefeſt Good and ultimate of all; but without conſultation or deliberation, raviſhed with its allſufficiencie and plenitude, tendeth naturally and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to it, as the laſt end of all, beyond which there is no paſſing: and beſides it, there is no ſtraying; as being immenſe. So that we may ſuppoſe <hi>Lucifer</hi> himſelfe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling naturally in perſpicacitie and intuitive knowledge, which he had of that abſolute Good, was ſo far ſurpriſed with its ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and perfection, that contenting not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be neer, contemplate, and enjoy it, affected to be that it ſelfe by ſacrilegious ambition, and ſo loſt what really he had, and was. So that we may perceive a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie conjunction between cleer and firme knowledge, and ſincere and fervent love: as there is a Morall (as they call it) neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of conjunction between Love, and the thing we ſo loved.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Under Love, (which is the very Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Bond of Chriſt and the Soule) we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Deſire allſo; which ſome make one kinde of Love, and Complacencie, another. But Complacencie being rather a Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of Love poſſeſſed of its Object, than any actuall appetite, may more properly be termed a ſatiation and reſt of the Soule. But
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59605:162"/> Love is an act or motion towards ſomewhat not fully, at leaſt, enjoyed. And though there may be a full fruition, the heart of man ceaſes not to love or deſire in ſome ſenſe: as when that actually and at preſent enjoyed, is deſired as abſent, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, for time to come. For as no man, according to the Philoſophie of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> hopeth for what he hath, ſo neither doth he deſire what he hath; but the deſire remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after poſſeſſion, is of the perpetuation, and indeficiencie of the ſame. As when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> at the Transfiguration of Chriſt, beholding and admiring the Glorie, did deſire Tabernacles to be erected, in which they might reſt further in the bleſſed ſtate they were then in. So much more full then as our knowledge is of God and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies in Chriſt, ſo much more ardent will be, and ſo much better ſettled, our love of them; and conſequently our union more intimate and fixed in them: anſwerable to which the Schoolmen as well as Myſticall Divines, have found out four degrees of Love divine (<hi>Thom.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>qu.</hi> 28. <hi>a.</hi> 5. <hi>Co.</hi>) <hi>Liquefaction, Fruition, Languor, and Fervour,</hi> which I hold not fit to be here inſiſted upon, as being more admirable than profitable. A more moderne Authour, and more truely and devoutly, reduceth all love of God to theſe three Heads: whereof the firſt cometh
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59605:163"/> onely through Faith, without gracious ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, or ſpirituall Knowledge of God; which is in the leaſt Soule reformed by Faith; and in the loweſt degree of Charity; which is good as ſufficing to ſalvation. The ſecond is that which a Soule feeleth through faith and imagination of Jeſus in his Manhood: which is better than the former, when the Imagination is ſtirred by Grace. For then the ſpirituall Eye is opened in beholding of his Humanitie. The third is Love that a Soule feeleth through ſpirituall ſight of the Godhead, in the Humanity, as it may be ſeen here, is the beſt and moſt worthy, and that is perfect love. This love a Soule feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not till it be reformed in feeling: Thus that Authour, in the <hi>Scale of Perfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But I eſteem that more uſefull and eaſie diſtinction of Love or Union with God alltogether ſufficient for all purpoſes requiſite to a good Chriſtian: For either we love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by Faith we know and ſee ſpiritually, things lovely or deſireable, as God in his Perfections, and Chriſt in his Mediation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and paſſive, and the holy Spirit in its operations Divine: Or we love becauſe we finde and feel the power of all theſe in the inward-man, by the ſenſe of the Love of God firſt in ſuch ſort manifeſted unto us. For as Saint <hi>Auſtine, Epiſt.</hi> 106. hath it (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the grounds laid by Saint <hi>John,</hi>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:59605:163"/> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4. 19.) <hi>Faith which worketh by love, would not work at all, unleſſe the very Love of God be firſt ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit, which is given to us.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. III. Of the exceſſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitive Love of God, in Extaſies and Raptures, with their abuſes and uſes noted.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. ALthough the principall deſigne in this Unitive Tractate be not to fill the Brain with gallant Speculations, and gay No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Union with God, yet becauſe it ſeemeth neceſſary to a competent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Love, wherewith God doth love us, and of that whereby we love God, to take in the Extent of it, it will not be amiſſe to conſider the doctrine and uſe of Extaſies, and Raptures, too much famed by ſome, and no leſſe defamed by others. For as ſupream Illuminations by Faith and Contemplation ordinarie do receive their Crown and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie by extraordinarie Revelations and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, God may, and doth ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to his Servants; ſo may it be that the top of ſpirituall Affections and Love ſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall, may touch the bottome of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Extaſies and Raptures: which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59605:164"/> tranſportations of the Soule above the pitch of common Love, though ſincere, ſound, faithfull, and ſaving. For in trueth, I ſcarce read of any Religion (except we make ſome factions, Religions) in which inſtances of wonderfull nature to this purpoſe, are not found: excepting the Mother faction of late. For others iſſuing from them, have gloried much of ſuch elevations and tranſportations: And Hiſtories and Relations very credible aſſure us, that of old, amongſt the Heathen, and at this day amongſt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> certain devout Perſons in their way, receive (after ſome Ceremonies uſed to that end) ſupernaturall impreſſions and Inſpirations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taticall. And why not? Since it is very probable that all Religions tending either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely or immediately to the worſhip of a Deity, whereby ſome honour, at large and blindly, is given unto the only true God, above what Atheiſts aſcribe to the ſame; and that according to the moſt probable Philoſophie about Spirits, there are divers kinds of them; ſome purer, others impurer; ſome moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, and miſchievous, others leſſe noxious; that God the moſt Wiſe, juſt, and infinite diſpenſer of all things, and diſpoſer, may give way to Spirits to enter into and cooperate with zealous Perſons in their ſimple, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe devotion to a Deity, and manage them according to the merits and manner of their
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59605:164"/> Profeſſion: So that in very trueth, faithfull and unerring judgement of a ſound Religion cannot be made from ſuch poſſeſſions and tranſportations; but on the contrary rather, that not the reality, but purity and divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch Extaſies are to be eſtimated from the reaſonableneſſe, trueth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Religion profeſſed by ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts. Onely this may be well granted, that ſuch Perſons by ſuch Enthuſiaſmes, are competently characterized for ſelect Perſons in their Profeſſions, whether Idolatrous, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, or Orthodox.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or may we not ſay; as there is one Fire neceſſary for the Cook to make his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels boyl over (for Extaſies are certain ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions of the ſpirit of a Man,) and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fire requiſite to the Smith, to temper and faſhion his Mettall, and another to the Founder for his ſervice: ſo ſeverall loves gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeverall heats, thoſe ſeverall heats have ſeverall effects upon divers Subjects which they work on. Certainly, though true and modeſt Believers ſhould not live or carrie themſelves ſo towards God, as if they would oblige him to extraordinarie Inſpirations or Motions to be granted them, ſo ſhould the modeſteſt of all demean themſelves in their Religion, as thereby they ſhould be more ſuſceptible of ſupererogated Gifts, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure running over, as the Goſpell ſpeakes,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59605:165"/> from God. Of which impartments, I doe verily believe the profeſſours of that Faction, who are Enemies to all preſcribed diſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall never be partakers; pretending their Divinity is too ſpirituall to trouble themſelves with ſuch Exerciſes, and they muſt goe the neareſt way to Chriſt, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of all bodily reverence, decencie, and due veneration: which conſiſts in ſelect out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formes and faſhions diſtinguiſhing to the ſenſe, divine from naturall, morall, or civill ſervices, as is moſt requiſite.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But as to Extaſies, of which we now ſpeak, as they are ſuch which God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to cauſe to the eminently conſtant and ſervent in his ſervice and worſhip, ſo may we not argue a certainty of Gods va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing thoſe Veſſels he ſo fills, as more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, or holy than ſome others, from which he with-holds ſuch gifts: though, where he ſo conferrs them, and they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of idle and Evill Spirits imitating di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, no doubt but there is ſome good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of holineſſe preceding, not common to all true Believers. For ſtill we muſt look on them as gifts to profit withall, and not as Graces, whereby men actually have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited. And the profit which ſucceeds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is rather of others than themſelves. For ſuch they are deſcribed to be, that in them ſometime the reaſon is taken away
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59605:165"/> from them who ſuffer them; and ſometime, their ſenſes. I ſcarce know what to judge of that ſaying of <hi>Antonie</hi> the Great, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly eminently devout, whatever Moderne Cenſurers may judge, which <hi>Caſſian</hi> in <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> relates, That no man arrives at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Prayer, who in Prayer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands what he ſayes: which poſſibly might give occaſion to moderner Authours to invent ſuch a kinde of Prayer which they call <hi>Supramentall:</hi> that is, ſuch which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Intelligence: but this I may preſume to ſay; that, if any whoſe Office it is to be the Voice of the People to God in Publique, (who then eſpecially ſhould together with him offer a reaſonable Sacrifice to God) ſhould affect or willfully fall into ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taticall formes of ſpeaking that neither he ſhould underſtand himſelfe, nor ſhould be underſtood by others, he muſt be owing to ſome other Spirit for ſuch his gifts, than that of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And for privation of Senſes in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, ſome Inſtances may be given very credible, during ſuch tranſlations of minde: which I dare neither raſhly applaud, nor condemn. But whether this was the caſe of that holy man <hi>Elpidius</hi> of whome the Auncients write, I know not; that he was wont to ſtand whole Nights in Prayer and praiſing God in Pſalmes (not in recitation
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59605:166"/> of Creeds and <hi>Ave Maries</hi>) with ſuch ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, that being once ſtung with a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, he changed not his <hi>poſture.</hi> Which might be aſcribed to an holy pertinacie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſenſe, not without ſenſe. But if evill Spirits entring into, and poſſeſſing Veſſells of diſhonour and impious, drown the ſenſes for that time; there is no incredibleneſſe, that the good Spirit of Grace and Peace, may overcome all ſenſations externall. Was it not ſo with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when, as we read, 2 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 12. he was wrapt up into the third Heaven, whether in the body or out of the body, he knew not? And 'tis moſt apparent that ſome Epilepticall diſtempers, bereave men both of ſenſe and Reaſon. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to us by <hi>Bodin, Theatr. Naturoe lib.</hi> 4. that in <hi>Germanie,</hi> divers men are wont to caſt themſelves by Witchcraft, into Extaſies in ſuch manner, that for the time, they feel no pain, by blowes, pinchings, or burnings; but returning to their common ſenſes, they preſently feel moſt grievous torments. And this I rehearſe, verily believing that God by his holy Spirit doth elevate ſome men ſo extraordinarily as that they exceed humane order in contemplations and ſenſations hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: and that evill Spirits may counterfeit notably the ſame effects in their Servants. And hereupon I leave theſe few Rules to all ſober, faithfull and devout Chriſtians, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59605:166"/> to the diſcerning of Spirits good and evill.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Firſt, they who purſue the great meanes ordained of God to arrive at the heighth of the Love of God uniting them to God, and cauſing an acquieſcence and reſt in him: ſo that in effect their reaſons and ſenſes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inconſiſting with ſuch perfection, ſhould be loſt in God and in Chriſt, and they live in the world undiſturbed by it; are lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably and ſafely extaticall.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Secondly, That they who may have ſurpaſſed others in the exerciſe of Chriſtian Vertues, and the Unitive Way with God, and no wayes aim at ſuch Perfections, or deſire them; as, at the beſt, not making the Soule more good, but more great rather, and not more dear or acceptable to him, which ſhould be every prime Chriſtians ſtudie and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, may have exaltations of this nature: which importunately coveted, may provoke God to deliver them over to deluſions of evill Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thirdly, Seeing counterfeit Ware comes too often under the countenance and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of what is pure and paſſing good; the ſoundneſſe of the faith profeſſed by ſuch, is not proved by ſuch exceſſes: but ſuch exceſſes muſt be rather judged by the Law and Teſtimonie of God, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes Chap. 8. upon which Faith is grounded,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59605:167"/> and by which, it is directed. For no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe true is that deſcription of <hi>Extaſies</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by that auncient Authour called <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> That <hi>Extaſies are a wiſdome putting a man beſides himſelfe,</hi> than that ſuſpenſion, or abſorption of naturall knowledge and underſtanding is occaſioned by the dominion of divine <hi>Irradiations</hi> true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called. So that this exceſſe of Light and Love muſt be it ſelfe ſubject to tryall, and that twofold principally: the one taken from the Antecedent; and the other from the Conſequent Circumſtances. For if ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe of believing, and divineneſſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having our ſelves lead not to theſe Extaſies, they are ſpurious and dangerous. Again, if ſuch tranſported mindes, thereupon fall into unreaſonable, unjuſt, or ridiculous actions inconſiſtent with the gravitie, and puritie of the divine Preſence there ſuppoſed, it is but reaſonable to ſuſpect, the Scene to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by idle Spirits. For Rapts of a Royall ſtamp, are ſuch as <hi>Gerſon</hi> deſcribes, <hi>An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall knowledge of God, obtained by a conjunction of ſpirituall affection:</hi> Which Unitive and experimentall knowledge may be had without the diſorder of the naturall underſtanding; and may allſo diſſetle it ſo as to depend, for ſome time, wholly upon Gods ſupportation and tranſportation: and that eſpecially in the eſtimation of the world,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59605:167"/> and common judgements. For thus was Chriſt judged to be, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 21. and that by his own Friends, beſides himſelfe: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> allſo, by <hi>Feſtus,</hi> and by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Believers; as may be gathered from 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 13.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. WHEN Meditation and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation are diſtinguiſhed, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are; Contemplation may be ſaid to be directed immediately to God, and the fixing of the minde and heart on him; and from, and through him, to caſt an eye on the Creatures and the various acts of his Providence, in which he is ſeen allſo with an Evening Light and Knowledge, as he is with a Morning Light (as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> was wont to ſpeak) by that immediate Intuition, which yet properly is to be attained onely in Heaven. But Meditation is the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of created things, not ſo much as they are in themſelves, which is the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of naturall Philoſophers, but as they
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59605:168"/> are effects of a Divine and ſupernaturall Power and deſigned to the aſſiſtance of dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and weaker Eyes, which are not able to behold the Glorie of God but as men doe the beauty of the Sun, in Water. And yet from hence, aſcent is made to a faithfull and fruitfull apprehenſion of God himſelfe: where the Soule mounted, as was <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> at the transfiguration of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to abide and have its reſidence for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Grace and Goodneſſe here being in their minoritie, yea and under Tutours and Governours, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 4. 2. We are not to take poſſeſſion of the promiſed and expected Inheritance, in this life: But the Methode hereunto is this, which we finde exemplified in <hi>David</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. <hi>I will behold thy face in righteouſneſſe here: when I awake I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſſe.</hi> For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> allſo ſaith, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 12. 2 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>We all with open face behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in a glaſſe, the glorie of the Lord, are changed as into the ſame Image, from glorie to glorie even as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> meaning hereby, that the Spirit of God concurring with the Glaſſe of Gods Creatures, and his revealed Word, gives us a true, but a diſtant and, ſo, dimme repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of God, as through Perſpectives. And theſe to improve to the beſt degree and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59605:168"/> advantage, is the great buſineſſe of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate here; as whereby we are dayly wrought to a conformity to the Image of Chriſt and God, defaced in us; and returne unto his likeneſſe, and a liking of him: which two are both Unitive of us to God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Union with him, according to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent capacity. For it is true in Religion what Philoſophie, in her Sphere, teaches: that the Underſtanding is made all things, anſwerable to its Object: the minde of man wonderfully conforming it ſelfe to ſuch things as are brought unto it by the Ear or Eye; and is in a manner figured by them: as we ſee that Water admitting any Body more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid than it ſelfe, into it ſelfe, gives way to it and receives the ſhape thereof within it ſelfe: as doth the Air allſo, though not ſo viſibly to our ſenſe. So the minde of man contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating and conceiving God and Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is formed or conformed to the ſame, morally; looſing its naturall ſhape and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and propenſities: which is thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minde, that ye may prove what is that good, that acceptable and perfect will of God.</hi> For inſtance, a man hearing and taking pleaſure in abſurd, rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and obſcene Diſcourſes or Books, (as is in part noted before) is conformed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59605:169"/> and corrupted therewith; the Images of things ſo imbibed or impreſſed, being with great difficulty to be removed, and with great facility and promptitude ſtirring up, or, at leaſt, yielding to ſinfull tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as occaſion ſhall be offered agreeably. And ſo in mens reading of the Hiſtories of far and unknown Countries, and the ſtrange fruits of the Earth, the motions of the Air, and temper differing from ours, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall formes of Beaſts and ſuch like Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doe beget an inclination in the minde to be preſent on the place. Likewiſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Battles, wiſe Stratagems, Valiant and bold Actions in others, inflame the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to an imitation. In like manner, he who converſes much with Religion, its ſtrange and preternaturall Notions, the ſublime Speeches, and heroicall Actions of Saints and Martyrs, and eſpecially the admirable deſigne, and Providence of God in Loſt mans Redemption and Reſtitution, perfourmed by Chriſt, cannot chooſe but finde and feel a diſpoſition in himſelfe, anſwering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made in his minde of them; where it is not notoriouſly peſter'd with earthly and vitious Habits prepoſſeſſing it; which by the foreſaid preſcriptions of the Purgative Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, muſt be firſt diſcharged, before any ſuch transformation, as we ſpeake of, can be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for. For no man can attain to any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourineſſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59605:169"/> or complacencie in any faculty whatever, untill by frequent practice, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a competent Maſter of ſuch Science or Art. So that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exceeding in theſe Exerciſes himſelfe, and thereupon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimenting the admirable effects of them in the vehement zeal for Gods glorie, ending in Raptures and Viſions Celeſtiall, commends the ſame Methode to his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> 4. 8. in theſe words, <hi>Till I come, give attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</hi> which are eaſily applicable to ſuch an attendance, whereupon Chriſt with his bleſſed Spirit, may enter into the Soule to its Illumination, Purgation and Conjunction with him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And though all the Scriptures, being given of God are profitable for Inſtruction and Edification, yet, as the glorie of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Bodies, differ in degrees; ſo ſome Lights in Gods Word produce both greater light and heat in men, than others doe: Whereupon it is expedient that choice be there made allſo of ſuch as may be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall upon a man: not excluding inferiour points as uſeleſſe, but inſiſting upon ſuch as are more honourable and weighty, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be meditated on.</p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:59605:170"/>
                  <p n="6">6. And to give ſome aſſiſtance here, to the weaker, in directions and inſtances of ſubjects proper for Meditation, not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to limit any ſtrictly to what I here offer; What if we ſhould diſtribute the Great Work of God in reſtoring, and renewing, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating the world, brought into ruine and confuſion by the fall of Man, into as many dayes as it pleaſed him to take for creating and forming of the naturall and Viſible world, at the firſt? And thus beginning on Munday, to conſider and meditate on the miſerable Chaos of confuſion into which all the world was reduced by Mans Apoſtacie from, and the ſeverall branches of the ſinne committed thereby againſt God, with the aggravations of guilt pertaining thereunto. And how God entertained within himſelfe, thoughts of reconciliation with Man ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; and to determine or decree the ſame by his Sons becoming Man, and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the great Work of Mediation. If on Tueſday, a man ſhould obſerve ſeriouſly and contemplate of the execution of this Decree, by Covenanting a ſecond time with <hi>Adam</hi> in behalfe of himſelfe and Poſteritie; this true and proper Covenant of Grace, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thereof in promiſing the Meſſias as a Mediatour and Redeemer; and the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love of God in giving his Onely Son to be Incarnate to that end. Thirdly, If on
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59605:170"/> Wedneſday we ſhould meditate, how upon this Day, God created light out of darkneſſe, and the light ſprang up to the Righteous; a Light of Hope and Life, and of help: by which we perfourme all ſpirituall Offices and workes, as we doe our naturall workes, by the light of the Sun, dayly. And if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation be true, and the reaſon of the <hi>Jew</hi> given to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Philoſopher, Why the Sun fails not to ſhine little or much every Wedneſday, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it was made on that Day, and ſo ſhining celebrates its own Nativitie; much greater reaſon is there, that we ſhould celebrate the praiſe of Gods mercy ſhining in the face of Jeſus Chriſt to us. If on Thurſday, we ſhould more particularly obſerve the ſeverall Raies of the glorious Body of Grace falling upon us here on earth: and how that he, who hath given his Son thus to us, will, and doth with him give us all things; ſo that the fat and the ſweet and the plentie of the creatures ordained to mans uſe are derived to him by Chriſt: through whome, as he made the Worlds, he adminiſters, and governs, and diſpoſes all things in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable order and Harmonie, filling even the naturall mans heart with food and gladneſſe; which ought to appear and utter it ſelfe in outward acts of gratitude and ſervice: riſing up from thence to the valuation more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and high of the ſpirituall Bleſſings,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59605:171"/> whereby he ſatisfieth the hungrie and thirſtie Soule after Righteouſneſſe, and the graces of the Goſpell, conducting to the glorie of God. And on Friday, how ample, noble, and patheticall Meditations may be had on the ſufferings and death of Chriſt for the ſins of the whole world, and the ſatisfying of Gods wrath due to man in extremitie, by the tearing of his Fleſh, and the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Blood, even to the death of the Croſſe for us: ſo fullfilling all Righteouſneſſe. And how reaſonable, juſt, and righteous a thing it is for all true Chriſtians to ſuffer for him and themſelves all ſuch hardſhips, of Abſtinences, Continences, Selfe-denialls, and bodily puniſhments, to be made like unto Chriſt, and more capable of the fruits and effects of his Interceſſion and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sixthly, On Saturday, to conſider the Reſt of Chriſt in the Grave; having finiſhed the ſeverall workes of our Redemption, as God did that Day the workes of Creation, reſting from them: And that we allſo ſhould reſt from ſuch workes of Nature corrupt, which may be called properly Ours; and ſo fit our ſelves to live and die, as that the next Day which we call <hi>Sunday,</hi> we may be fitted for a bleſſed and joyfull Reſurrection; And being then raiſed from the death of ſin unto the life of Righteouſneſſe, we may keep a perpetuall Jubilee of Holineſſe and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59605:171"/> Happineſſe, elevating our mindes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Power of God, the glorie of Chriſt raiſed from the dead, aſcended up into Heaven, ever to make interceſſion for us, labouring here under ſeverall conflicts, untill we allſo reign together with him. Which future ſtate may well deſerve the beſt and higheſt of our thoughts, as that where the imperfecter union of faith and love we can attain here, ſhall receive its abſolute and moſt perfect conſummation hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But untill that fullneſſe of time, or time of fullneſſe ſhall come, the minde of man is wonderfully helped and exalted by the exerciſe of the contemplation of God in his beautie, and goodneſſe: which is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very effectuall upon men, for the quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and fixing of the unſetled minde, in great peace and tranquillitie from the mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of this world: though at the ſame time there be found no ſmall ſollicitude how to preſerve that comfortable ſtate unſhaken, and the purity thereof undefiled: being, with <hi>Peter,</hi> at the glorie of Chriſts Tranſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, loth to goe down the Mountain where ſuch manifeſtations are made.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And the Myſtery of Godlineſſe in this caſe is truely wonderfull; if a man conſiders that not onely the way to this conjunction with God is purification of the Bodie and Soule from earthly uncleanneſſes; but ſuch
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59605:172"/> Union and Converſe with God doth change the Faces, at leaſt; that is, the outward formes of men not truely fitted or ſanctified to ſuch an end. Hence is a reſolution in ſome meaſure made, of a doubt ſeeming difficult to me: Who perceiving hereticall and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, and men of unjuſt lives to make a fair appearance of good outward, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching the more ſcandalous Vices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſound Piety, could not but wonder how an erroneous faith, and unrighteous and uncharitable demeanours in a Chriſtian courſe ſhould attain to ſo much as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable formalitie of Godlineſſe. For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very appearance of holineſſe, though there ſhould be nothing more in the caſe, is in it ſelfe laudable. The reaſon of all this I take to be, the ſtrange forwardneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch abound with in preſſing, though indirectly into Gods Preſence; affecting mountainous phraſes, and phanſying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves intimate with God himſelfe. For as Conſpiratours and Traitours frequenting the Kings Court and Preſence, and obſerving what is perfourmed of ſuch as doe him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervice, and attend him, can, and doe eaſily and more artificially comport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as prime Subjects; Or (to uſe Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s compariſon) As he that ſhall come into a Drugſters ſhop where Aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Spices are pounded, ſhall, whether he
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59605:172"/> will or not, carrie away upon his Clothes, ſome of the fragrancies which are there ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; Or, laſtly, as the Cenſers of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> with their Complices, became holy by being brought, though in a wicked manner, into Gods Preſence and devoted to his ſervice; ſo ill-grounded, and ill-adviſed Devotion to God doth make ſome alteration very laudable in men, reſembling God himſelfe and his holineſſe. So that as ſinceritie of Intention, purity of Affection, and Actions innocent and righteous doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to ſpirituall mindedneſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of, and union with God, ſo doe even that prepoſterous way of converſing with God, and preſſing unduly into Gods Preſence, divers times worke ſome good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect outwardly, at leaſt, upon men. And were it not that where Divine Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are orderly performed and faithfully, a reall and ſound improvement of Chriſtian Graces and Vertues was allſo made, and the Soule became not more like unto God ſo viewed and enjoyed, it muſt needs have been an errour in Scholaſticall Divines, to preferre the Contemplative Life, or the Life of <hi>Mary;</hi> before the Practicall, or the Life of <hi>Martha</hi> ſerving Chriſt: reſtraining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation to that way had in this world: which beginning on ſuch low and ſenſible Subjects as are before recited; may riſe to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59605:173"/> greater perfection in the more immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition of God himſelfe, and the glorie to be revealed.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. FROM the two-fold Union with God ſpoken of, Contemplation or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Love, proceeds as a neceſſarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of both, Adoration, which conſiſts in an actuall Devotion; and Conſecration of the whole man unto God, and an <hi>inanition,</hi> or emptying of a mans Soule into the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, as the ſmaller, as well as grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rivers fall into the Ocean and looſe themſelves; the Channell through which they run, remaining the ſame, and allwayes in thoſe ſtreames moving. Or when as two intimate Friends of the ſame judgement, and equally affectionate one to another, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, after mutuall embraces, fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Diſcourſes moſt kinde and pleaſing one with another: So the foreſaid meeting of the Soule with God begets conference and holy Talk with God in Prayer. It was not therefore thought ſufficient by <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59605:173"/> to have procured followers of his Doctrine, nor attenders of his Perſon; nor by Chriſt, to have choſen his Apoſtles, who ſhould be allwayes neer him by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, unleſſe he taught them to pray, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. For Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or Adoption, whereby we have God for our Father, ſufficeth not without he be our heavenly Father; and under that notion uſe Invocation of him, and holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with him by the Aſcent of the heart to him in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And Prayer being of a very compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive nature may be conſidered in its Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, which is a generall and conſtant diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the minde to God, of which ſort we may underſtand Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeake, 1 <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Pray all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes:</hi> and <hi>Pray without ceaſing:</hi> by aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Affections from earthly things, and raiſing and continuing the ſame to, and with God. That ſo, when ever God by any tacite ſuggeſtion ſhall ſay to the Soule, <hi>Seek ye my face:</hi> an Anſwer and Act may allwayes be in readineſſe, ſaying, <hi>Thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> For actuall Prayer is the exerciſe of that generall diſpoſition men have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God: and differs no more from that than the Fire covered and the Fire kindled: which latter when it ceaſes, leaves new Coals apt to a repetition of the like flames. And
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:59605:174"/> thus aſcending unto God, and for the time abiding with him; we are eſtranged from terreſtriall buſineſſes and cogitations. From which conſideration a tolerable reaſon may be given, why divers praying together, in the concluſion are wont to ſalute one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as newly met. For this we are wont to doe after a far Journey taken, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: ſo having been as far as Heaven it ſelfe in Prayer, and wholly (as we ought at leaſt) eſtranged from things below, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning take Acquaintance with our Friends and Brethren: Or perhaps having been ſo united to God, as in ſuch caſes becomes us, the Center of all Chriſtian Charitie whereby we meet alltogether, we teſtifie our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Affection thereby encreaſed, with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Salutations outward.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But this is perfourmed as well (that is, as really though not ſo edifyingly) in ſingle addreſſes, as in Society; when a man makes known unto God that which would not be ſo proper to have publiſhed to others: of which we may ſpeake by and by. For though, for dayly and common Sacrifice, Gods Houſe and Altar is the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, yet we may obſerve that thoſe extraordinarie Revelations and Viſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in Auncient and inferiour Hiſtories, to be made to the eminent Servants of God, have been obtained chiefly in private retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59605:174"/> from the Noiſe and Duſt of the World. <hi>Elias</hi> was ſo viſited by God in the cleft of a Rock, and <hi>Moſes</hi> in the wide Wilderneſſe alone, when God gave him the ſignall of his Preſence by the <hi>Fire in the Buſh.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> counſells to enter into a mans own heart, and commune with that in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; as an excellent expedient to draw God to a friendly conference with him, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to him, anſwerable to his exigence. Exceeding capable, and many times, ſenſible is the minde ſo erected to God ſeparated from buſineſſes of the world, of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of abſtractions of that nature. And the Trances of <hi>Daniel, Peter,</hi> and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably of <hi>Paul,</hi> befell them in ſuch retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without the concurrence of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or the Mediation though not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Holy Spirits, which we never read in Scripture to be Interceſſours, in any kinde, to God, in behalfe of the Saints here labouring, but onely Miniſters and Delegates of God to perfourme his pleaſure to ſuch as ſo wait for him, and call upon him. And as for Saints in Heaven, we never ſo much as read in Holy Scripture, that they were ſent at any time by God to miniſter unto his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants here on Earth, as Angells have been: neither are we directed by the Word of God to have any communication with them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or ſenſible. It muſt needs therefore be
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59605:175"/> a third Oeconomie of God, as yet unreveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beſides that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Chriſt, which aſſignes us new intermediate Objects or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles of our Prayers to God, no wayes made known by God; but deviſed by humane ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations, intruding into things not ſeen; and founded on preſumptions not known, nor demonſtrable, but by ſuch inſtances and examples of miraculous Apparitions which may more than ſuffice to turne the ſtomach from ſwallowing them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But preſumption it is, not to goe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in Scripturall Road preſcribed us, to Allmighty God; but to goe out of it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it modeſty, but rather a double impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to alter the courſe of our Devotion to God, in importuning them to ſollicite for us who never gave us the leaſt intimation or encouragement ſo to doe, and in not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the direct Precept given by Chriſt, as our Great Mediatour, and by God himſelfe as our heavenly Lord and Father. Whence doth it appear that God is of more difficult acceſſe ſince the coming of Chriſt than he was before? Or when? and how became the priviledges of Gods faithfull Children under Chriſt inferiour to them under <hi>Moſes?</hi> Did the ſouls of the faithfull then make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate approaches unto God, and claſpe him, and may we not? or in trueth, ought we not much rather ſo to doe, as well for
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59605:175"/> the glorie of God, ſome of which muſt needs fall ſhort of God, and ſtick to the hands that ſhould ſo offer our worſhip to God, and that whether thoſe holy Spirits will or not, (we fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the puritie of our intention, and modeſtie and innocencie of our expreſſions ſo applying our ſelves) as allſo for our comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which muſt needs be more full, the more immediate and ſtrict our conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is with God: <hi>our fellowſhip</hi> (as Saint <hi>John</hi> tells us) being <hi>with the Father and the Son:</hi> and that ſurely will bear us out in all immediate approaches to God; but ſcarce allow application to others, which are onely commendable where the bond of civill Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in this life, the ground of the exerciſe of ſpirituall Offices to one another, is not diſſolved, as it is when we are ſeparated by Death. So that we can onely in Chriſt, (excluſively) come with that boldneſſe, and acceſſe with confidence by the faith of him, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12. but with ſuſpicions, fears, and doubtings, untill cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marineſſe hath blinded the minde ſo far that it cannot ſee afar off. And then, if it fares with us as it happens to poor Suppliants ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an earthly King ſurrounded with his Guards and Nobles, that they cannot come at his Majeſtie, no wonder; unleſſe it could appear that it was any ones appointed Office, or Office of all, to be Maſters of requeſt to God, on our behalfe.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. AS there are Guards of Princes whoſe Office it is to puſh off with Pikes and Staffs ſuch as would preſſe into their preſence; ſo Evill Spirits are allwayes at hand making it their Office to hinder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Soules coming to God, by their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and obſtructions: and either by wholly putting us off that we approach not at all; or by pulling us off, engaged; ſo that we ceaſe in ſpirit when we proceede in words and outward appearance; ſo that we may be ſaid to draw nigh unto him with our Lips, while our Hearts are far from him: a thing much diſallowed by God, yet not in all alike. For the ſpirit and minde of Man are naturally fickle, light, vain, various, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on many things, and <hi>Dinah</hi>-like gadding abroad to ſee the Daughters of the Land, and viſiting ſtrange Objects, while they ſhould keep home, and minde their Fathers buſineſſe. And of the heart, it may be ſaid, what was ſaid of <hi>Ruben, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable as waters thou ſhalt not excell.</hi> For what powerfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be expected in that Prayer which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59605:176"/> is prepared for God and deſigned, but falls ſhort of him; as an Arrow ſhot from an unbent or halfe broken Bow. And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable as well as unlikely is it, that God ſhould heare us when we ſcarce heare our ſelves? For as when the outward Eye ſeemes to be fixed ſtedfaſtly on an Object, the minde in the mean time carried ſtrongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another Object, doth not ſee what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, many times; ſo though in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance outward, a man ſeems wholly bent to Godward, yet his heart being drawn off him to private Objects, which it more phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, he ſpeaketh in Prayer, not to God but to men or the open Air. And it muſt needs be no ſmall derogation from the greatneſſe of God, to be thus mocked by the world, catching up that by the way which is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing towards him: and the Sacrifice maimed or blemiſhed by the fingring of Evill Spirits, which was devoted wholly to God: and at the ſame time that we have warme affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards the world, to ſet cold Meat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. So that in this manner ſupinely and ſlothfully to requeſt any thing at Gods hands, muſt needs be a provocation to God to denie us rather than to gratifie us: It is little better than an Idoll which is ſet up in the heart which drawes the current of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to it ſelfe, intended for God: and ſuch God threatens in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> to anſwere
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59605:177"/> by himſelfe; but not in Mercie, but in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And it was the opinion of an Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and devout Scholar in the School of Chriſt; that if God ſhould judge a man for no other thing but his wandring and vain thoughts in praying to him, he were not able to ſtand before him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This in trueth is the Law of Prayer, and this is the end of praying, that we ſhould have, and keep our mindes erected unto God; and to attain this, ſhould be the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of all good Chriſtians: But if not onely God ſhould be ſo extreme to mark what is thus done amiſſe, but man ſhould be ſo rigorous to himſelfe, to judge himſelfe according to his demerits, he might fear and deſpair to undertake this ſacred Dutie. For who can ſay, (on this ſide of Heaven) I am clean from this common Contagion? So vigilant and active is the Devill; ſo fugitive and fickle is mans minde naturally; ſo many Acquaintances hath he in the world that are conſtantly knocking at his Door (as it were) to ſpeak with him a little, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven while he is buſie with God himſelfe, that very difficult it is, without great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and obſtinacie (and to uſe theſe is allſo very difficult) to attend upon the Lord without diſtraction, though but for a ſeaſon. When Complaint was made to an Auncient Holy Man by a Novice in ſevere
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59605:177"/> life, that he was wonderfully infeſted with idle thoughts in praying unto God; he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to goe abroad, and gather the Winde into his Lap: But, ſaid he, Father I cannot doe it. No more, ſaid he, canſt thou ſtay thy thoughts at thy pleaſure, from waving and wandering. Which we mention, not for Perſons under pretence of frailty and humane infirmitie, to connive at ſuch failings in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuffering them patiently ſo to rule, without any Cenſure or due ſenſe of ſuch evill. For it is one part of a Chriſtians Militarie Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in this life, to war againſt the Law of his minde thus oppoſing him: and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to arme himſelfe for the Encounter, by theſe, or the like meanes and helps in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Firſt then, it is neceſſarie he ſhould underſtand what he ſayes to God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the language he uſes at ſuch times ſhould be known to him. For next to, if not alltogether impoſſible it is, that a man ſhould minde that which was never in his minde, as ſtrange Languages are not. And how can the heart be actually united to God in it knowes not what?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Secondly, To avoid alienation of minde in Prayer, it is requiſite a man ſhould be well preadviſed of his danger in erring, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſtand more upon his watch and guard; and eſpecially not give way to ſtrange thoughts, though civill, modeſt, yea religious in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59605:178"/> kinde. For the experience of divers have found it to be true, and matter of complaint, that at no other time a man ſhall have ſo manie prettie, wittie, and often uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cogitations come into his head, as in the time of Prayer. Better contrivances of worldly affairs will be then injected than at other times he could hit of. Somtimes ſome acute and uſefull diſtinction in ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and difficult Points of Divinity. And perhaps a very plauſible notion of praying right, ſhall fall into his minde hindering him from actually praying aright: Theſe and ſuch like are mighty temptations to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and hold the minde from its more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Dutie. But more groſſe and avoidable much are they which are the remains of ſome evill affection or paſſion we generally carrie about us, and onely formally put by for the preſent: which will not be put off ſo, but as rude Fellowes in a Croud or great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, where civill diſtance is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, having heard the word of ſome in Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſaying, <hi>Stand off,</hi> give back for the preſent, and ſuddenly again preſſe forward among their betters: ſo idle, and vain, if not directly evill thoughts being put off for a moment, while we attend Gods ſervice, ſuddenly break their bounds, and moleſt us. Theſe Contingencies (as we may Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy call them) ought duely to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59605:178"/> and the minde fortified with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions againſt the aſſaults ſo made: And be well aſſured againſt the appearance of the uſefullneſſe of ſome cogitations: that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not ſeaſonable (as theſe are not) cannot be reaſonable nor religious: And as for thoſe thoughts which proceed from ſome lurking Vice covered for the preſent, as they are evill at all times, ſo are they of a double guilt, interpoſing in ſacred Actions. And the beſt, no better than golden Apples thrown in our way, by the Envier of all good Actions, to ſtop our direct courſe to Godward.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another proper meanes to conſtancie in the good intended, is, to begin well, and ſet out at firſt with good advice; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with our ſelves, what we doe; whoſe we are; before whome we come; whome we ſerve; and for what we ſo draw nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; whoſe Majeſtie is incomparable, whoſe ſeat is in Heaven and we upon Earth; and that to trifle with him is to arme him againſt our own Soules; and pull down a Curſe upon our heads inſtead of a Bleſſing. But trifle we doe, when with our mouthes we worſhip him, and our hearts are far from him. But though no man is to allow in himſelfe ſuch deviations, yet where they are involuntarie, rather than affected, a mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their evill may be in ſome degree
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59605:179"/> expected from the firſt generall, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall deſigne of offering an entire Sacrifice to God. A man was by no meanes, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing to God which was maimed, or imperfect: but if he had choſe an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect Sheep, Lamb, or Heifer to give to God and it happened to fall lame by the way, as it was driving to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> I know not whether ſuch were refuſed. A man muſt therefore chooſe and intend the beſt he can, and if in praying it happens againſt his will and deſire, to halt by the way, God may accept the ſame, a man not approving that acceſſorie imperfection.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A fourth expedient then may be, the obtaining the Spirit of Prayer. And by the Spirit of Prayer not that preſumptuous gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe vain men boaſt of, but that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Diſpoſition, that habituall Prayer which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commends to us when he ſaid, <hi>Pray without ceaſing:</hi> not requiring that our Tongue ſhould allwayes be going, but that, as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 26. 8. <hi>The deſire of our ſoule is to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee.</hi> And the heart is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the heart is fixed, as <hi>David</hi>'s was, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 57. 9. and 108. 1. Upon and from ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall addiction of the minde to God, doe flow a readineſſe, and regularneſſe in the actuall exerciſe of Prayer towards God, the Mouth ſpeaking, and the minde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59605:179"/> according to the good ſtock treaſured in the heart.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Fifthly, Habituall Pietie not alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to bear a man up in his Dutie herein, frequent reflexions upon our ſelves is very neceſſary to recover our ſelves faultring or tripping in ſuch caſes. Some hot mettall'd Jades will ſet out too fiercely, but ſoon flagge in travailing; and muſt be ſpurred up and quickened often to perfourm their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as they ought, and ſo muſt the fickle fervour of divers which endureth for a time and faileth without freſh excitations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And ſixthly, Peradventure care is to be had, that a man be not too anxious or ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous in praying, leſt he ſhould not pray as becometh him; and ſo by the Artifice of the Devill, a man becomes diſtracted in his thoughts, leſt he ſhould be diſtracted. For the minde of man cannot be very intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two things at a time, no more than by his will he can ſerve two Maſters at the ſame time. A fault apprehended in a mans ſelfe, ſuddenly condemned, preſently correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by applying himſelfe to the true Object, may ſuffice without ſuch a long cenſuring himſelfe, as may hinder rather than farther the action in hand.</p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:59605:180"/>
                  <p n="9">9. Laſtly, A certain revenge upon a man, and a conſcience towards God for defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of his due ſervice, and himſelfe of the benefit of Prayer by vain Aberrations, may be uſefull here, which is this: That upon a ſenſe of ſuch ſtrayings in his thoughts in time of Prayer, he puniſhes his Carnall part deſireing to be at liberty, by going o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again with that which he once perfourm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo negligently: For hereby allſo, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo reſolved to doe, he ſhall be revenged of the Tempter; and cauſe him to be leſſe buſie in moleſting him afterward, finding ſuch evill ſucceſſe in his wiles; and ſo good effect of a bad Cauſe.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VII. Of the due uſe of Publique and Private Prayer.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WHerefore (think we) did God build the ſpacious and beautifull Temple of this World; this Univerſe, which we behold and admire, but to make known the glorie of his Majeſtie, and that it being known by us, ſhould affect us with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable zeale to celebrate his Prayſe, all the wayes he hath taught us, and all that we can deviſe; not repugnant to his own
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59605:180"/> preſcriptions? They therefore that would ſhrink up all Devotions into an Houſe of their own, nay peradventure into their own breſt, and a narrow dark corner of the heart, judging that alltogether ſufficient, doe in a manner, implicitely lay a ſlight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Creation of the World by God, as ſuperfluous, ſeeing be might have been as great and glorious in himſelfe without that. But the ſame Spirit, if not Perſon that ſaid, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 11. <hi>Thy Word have I hid in mine heart</hi>—ſaid allſo <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40. 10. <hi>I have not hid thy righteouſneſſe within my heart, I have declared thy faithfullneſſe and thy ſalvation: I have not concealed thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindeneſſe and thy trueth from the great Congregation:</hi> intimating unto us, that the ſtock of Grace inwardly, muſt not be kept ſo (as it were) under Lock and Key, as not to appear publiquely to the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of him, to whome, as Money bearing his Image and ſuperſcription, it properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth. The <hi>Houſe of God</hi> ſo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is devoted to his ſervice, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the moſt proper place of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; that being like the Treaſurie-Chamber of Kings, and great Princes, into which all Duties are to be paid, and out of which, all undue favours are to be diſpenſed. And therefore ſurely, as greater glory is given to God by publique than by private Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59605:181"/> ſo greater Bleſſings may be from thence expected. And though common Prayers wherein many agree to glorifie God in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate places, is to be preferred before ſingle Devotion: the ſame ſervice in Gods Houſe, as more publique and exemplarie, muſt needs be more acceptable than that of private Places. Chriſt ſaid indeed, to confound Hypocrites ſeeking praiſe of men: <hi>When thou prayeſt enter into thy Cloſſet and ſhut thy Door,</hi> &amp;c. never intending to confine men to their Chambers, in praying: but to cut off oſtentation in Prayer; which yet may be avoided in publique Prayers: The Devill therefore envying the glory of God, and the edification of Chriſtians in faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Charitie to one another, and a more powerfull acceſſe to God, and a more proſperous ſucceſſe of publique Prayers there offered, muſt needs have a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in that ſacrilegious doctrine of detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the honour and efficacie of publique Prayers, in matching private with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſay, God is in all places, that he is: They ſay, God dwelleth not in Temples made with hands: They ſay, God can hear us in all places, at home as well as at Church; and in Private as well as in Publique. And in ſaying this and the like, they ſay they know not what. For doth God dwell in Cloſſets or Halls, or Parlours, or Kitchins,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59605:181"/> and doth he not dwell in Temples made with hands? Is it not ſaid expreſſely of the <hi>Temple,</hi> that it is the <hi>place where his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour dwells, Pſalm</hi> 26. 8. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 29. 9. And are not there expreſſe Promiſes fixed there above other places? If it be ſaid, Thoſe things were Jewiſh, Let them tell me, if they were not <hi>Gentile</hi> allſo; if among all Nations civiliz'd and profeſſing Religion, and among all Chriſtians, ſo ſoon as they were able and permitted to have Publique places, they carried not their Sacrifices to them, to be tender'd to God: and ſhall private ſenſes of ignorant perſons in the Scriptures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed upon without knowledge or ground, preponderate all theſe? And hereunto (not to repeat here what hath elſewhere been more fully diſcuſſed) we may adde the Mock which is too often put upon God and Religion by this Opinion; ſo that very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten God is not worſhipped at all in Private, by divers who plead for ſuch private Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: which is ſecurely paſſed over uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, becauſe no man can witneſſe to the contrary. But I may ſay ſafely, no men generally make a greater Conſcience of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping, in their proper ſeaſons, in Private, than they who moſt frequent the Publique worſhip. For Private worſhip was onely intended for an Auxiliarie and ſupplie of what we could not perfourme publiquely:
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59605:182"/> which I can ſcarce think God will accept of, when it is grounded upon ſuch a falſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as making Private, equall to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer joyntly with others; or to ſuch publique Prayer which in Gods Houſe is by private and ſingle Perſons made to God, agreeable to the Primitive practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſo early as they had ſuch places to pray in, and never laid down but where an unluckie, and precipitant zeal againſt a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Religion, hurried men forward to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unwarrantable alterations in Religion, not in one Church, nor one Age received and practiſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And againſt this, makes nothing, what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands:</hi> but teaches how we ſhould pray; where-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and when-ever we pray; that is, Lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up holy hands. And that we ſhould rather pray any where than no where; but not excluding Prerogatives of ſome places above others. They write of <hi>Lombard,</hi> that being reproached by the Devill for praying in an Houſe of Office, (an unſeemly place for ſo holy an Action, as a man may think) he anſwered him; Here, and any where elſe I may pray unto my God: which is moſt true in ſome caſes; but 'tis not true there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that one place is not better than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pray in, or that all are alike to God
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59605:182"/> in all reſpects, ſaving that of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Companie to meet in. But neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie may conſecrate any Place, and affected choice of privacie, when circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire publique and open worſhip, may <hi>deſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,</hi> or unhallow any Room; making it unfit to ſerve God, and the worſhip it ſelfe unpleaſing to God: So that, to me, it is not eaſie to reſolve, whether the moderner way ſo much applauded by ſome, of conſtancie of Family-meetings in Prayers to the keeping the Church vacant, and the Doors ſhut at all times allmoſt, but when a man ſcarce dares ſtay away, have not robbed God of more glorie and worſhip than they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him; the exception lying onely good, where there can be no acceſſe to the publique Place.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But I know not what vitious and very blameable modeſty hath poſſeſſed ſo many of late dayes, as to be affraid to be ſeen, or taken praying: and ſundry devout Perſons are ſtartled and ſhrink to be ſeen unawares at their Prayers in Gods Houſe it ſelfe: which is the Houſe of Prayer, unleſſe when the Bells publiſh the dutie at hand, and an Aſſembly is made profeſſedly, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at their domeſtick and ſeparate Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as if they were taken in a fault, or ſome Crime, whereof a man ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and affraid; ſome men being more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59605:183"/> ſeen to doe well, than others are, taken in an evill Action. This cannot be well thought of by God, whoſe ſervice a man is then engaged in; and cannot but be an infirmitie in men praying. For though a man is not hypocritically and with no better deſigne than to be noted and praiſed by men, to expoſe ſtudiouſly himſelfe to the view of others, while he prayes, he is no leſſe obliged not to forbear what place, and time, and juſt occaſion require at his hands, or otherwiſe may be expedient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe people ſee him. For God ſayes, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men that they may ſee your good works and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven:</hi> and the manifeſtation of our Adoration and ſervice, is likewiſe a manifeſtation of his honour and glorie. And if at length we could recover and bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Reputation ſuch loſt good Actions as publique Prayer in private Perſons, Religion would be more renowned, and many more than now doe, would allſo fall down, and ſay; <hi>God is in you of a trueth,</hi> and ſo be excited to the ſame good work, or worſhip in uſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But a known time of Gods Worſhip being aſſigned, a ſound, entire, tryed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Sacrifice and reaſonable ſervice of God being appointed, for Confeſſion, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, Supplications, Petitions, Depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59605:183"/> Interceſſions, Thankſgivings, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> directeth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. with ſobrietie or good Conſcience; to contemne theſe either ignorantly or preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly, and to foiſt in private Inventions ſcarce ſo good as humane, all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, what amounts this to but a deſpiſing of Chriſt himſelfe, and a provocation of God to caſt the officious zeal of ſuch, as dung upon their own faces? For how can it be ſuppoſed that God ſhould be pleaſed with that Oblation obtruded upon him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without Autoritie; which is often put up without Faith, and never with Charitie or Humilitie convenient? But if our Prayers themſelves offend, how ſhould we hope for pardon of our offences by them? That therefore they ſhould have favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to God, is neceſſarie they ſhould be dulie qualified themſelves; and that ſuch as theſe Conditions, here onely to be named, be found in them: 1. That we pray in Faith that God is; and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of all that call upon him. 2. That we pray in trueth, without any hereticall or erroneous Dogmes, or corrupt Opinions of God, of his Word or holy Worſhip. 3. Praying in puritie of intention; ſeeking, even when our Prayers conſiſt of ſpirituall or temporall benefits to our ſelvles, primarily the glorie and good will of God. 4. In Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59605:184"/> or holineſſe of hands; that is, innocencie of life, as <hi>David,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocencie, and ſo will I goe to thine Altar;</hi> or at leaſt, a diſlike of our guilt and contaminations; making them part of our humiliation and ſupplications to God. 5. In Charitie towards others, ſo far as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Pietie will permitt. And laſtly, In zeal to Gods ſervice, and to our own Soules in ſo praying (which is that lifting up the Soule, we ſo much ſpeak of here) and leaving it with him to preſerve to his greater ſervice and glorie, and our immortall happineſſe.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. NOw, becauſe there are uſually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed ſeverall kinds of Prayer to God, as well according to the matter, as manner of putting up our requeſts to him, all concurring in this one thing, that the minde and heart ſhould be thereby united to God and fixed, it will not be amiſſe to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59605:184"/> glance at the principall in this ſecond order, having touched the former from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. All which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the matter of Prayer, and may be perfourmed in any one of thoſe which great Artiſts have caſt into this threefold Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> Senſible, Mentall, and Supramentall. Senſible they make that which is common to all Chriſtians praying to God in a vocall, ſenſible manner to themſelves and others. Mentall they would have that called, which is contemplative, and whereby the minde is throughly directed to God, not without affection. For if the Underſtanding onely be erected and directed to God, it can ſcarce deſerve the name of <hi>Prayer to God,</hi> as Philoſophizing about him; therefore it is neceſſarie, that affectionateneſſe and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God by love, which are acts of the will allſo, ſhould be found in all due Prayer: yea in all Treaters of the nature and uſe of Prayer; otherwiſe, acute and learned men may preſcribe better than teach, or affect. A manifeſt Example we have in the two great Chieftains amongſt School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Angelicall, and <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> the Seraphicall Doctour, as they call them. Both which have (in their <hi>Opuſcula</hi>) written Treatiſes of the Love of God. In which the former keeping cloſer than in ſuch a Subject is expedient, to Scholaſticall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59605:185"/> and termes of writing, hath left but a dry Monument and inſipide to a ſpirituall Palate, of his gift in that kinde: whereas <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſpeaking out of the abundance of the heart, and affection, as the Subject required, rather than by the rule of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſquiſitions, hath much more divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, commendably, and profitably, as to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, treated thereof. And ſpirituall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and devotion towards God ſeem much to reſemble the Notion we generally have of the nature of Spirits in themſelves; which (they ſay) conſiſteth in not being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by limits as our Bodies are; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, and diffuſive: very much like to the bodie of the Air in which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed: which is capable of any figure, but determined to none. In like manner Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Prayer, and the gifts God beſtoweth upon the Soule, are not to be limited by the lineaments and parts of humane Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, which, as it were, fetters the Spirit from expatiating according to its pleaſure, which like the Winde, bloweth and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and leadeth as it liſteth; and is in very deed, as Phanatiques terme it, ſtinted, and obſtructed by the Arts of Men modelling their Devotion, and not ſubject rather to it, and following rather than going before its dictates and impulſes. For however I finde many Commentatours ingeniouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59605:185"/> and acutely methodizing holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Analyzing it ſo as if it had been the very intent and deſigne of the Holy Spirit therein to ſpeak Logically and metho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dically, yet could never be ſo really perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but that holy Men of old ſpeaking and writing as they were moved by the Spirit, contemned all order and Methods, but what naturally aroſe from the bowells of the Subject they treated of, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion given them: not contradicting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying liberty to men to forme their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by outward Methods, as may agree beſt with the learning, retaining, and digeſting what they finde there delivered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And anſwerable to this, the more Mentall a mans Contemplations are, the leſſe methodicall are they wont to be: So that if there be ſuch a thing as may be called proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Prayer Supramentall,</hi> as Authours ſpeak, it muſt be more ſtrange to Order and Methode than either of the two other degrees of Prayer: and be of the nature of Rapts and Extaſies, of which we have ſpoken. For by ſuch puritie of intention, and ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of intenſion, and ardour in directing a mans minde and heart to God; and, as it were, delivering up his ſpirit into his hands, the intellectuall facultie may ceaſe: which is that Abſorption ſpoken of allſo: and ſuch, that can be approved onely from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59605:186"/> and Divineneſſe ſo pored on, and with its luſtre confounding them carried away with it. For it is apparent, that Evill Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits doe in like manner oppreſſe the mindes of the Perſons devoted to them. And therefore as I cannot condemne all ſuch exceſſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or ſupramentall rather; ſo can I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them no farther than they are conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Law, and the Teſtimonie, and the Spirit of the Living Prophets; I mean the Church, truely ſo called, and the peace and Charitie of the ſame. So that as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think favourably of thoſe extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant paſſages, and ruleleſſe, while the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of them keep the peace of the Church, and known principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, innovating nothing in the Faith, but onely in their own ſupramentall Facts, as we may terme them; ſo can I no wayes ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie thoſe preſumptuous Spirits, who, not having attained to the true mentall Prayer, dare obtrude their vocall and ſenſible Prayer upon the ſpirits of an whole Congregation, and that without any good Autority ſo to doe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After the extraordinary gift of unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Prayer ceaſed in the Church of God, together with unprepared preaching of the Goſpell, it lay upon the Governours of the Church to ſupplie that defect in the beſt manner they could, by compoſing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59605:186"/> formes for Publique Worſhip: leſt any ſcandall or indecencie ſhould diſaffect ſoberer, and more prudent Chriſtians. And when the Biſhop preſiding in the Church committed any part of his wide charge to his Presbyter, we never finde that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in the Publique Worſhip from what was in uſe in the Mother-Church, either as to matter or forme. Nay, the principall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour of any Dioceſe never was himſelfe ſo imperious over his Flock, as vain men of late dayes, to offer a new and unknown Office to Believers every day; or to God, as more ſpirituall, or acceptable to him: but aymed at nothing more than a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, plain, well-known, well-approved and conſtant forme of ſound words, to which all intelligent Chriſtians might ſafely and cheerfully give their concurrence, and ſett to their Seal of <hi>Amen.</hi> And to denie liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Miniſters to offer the Will-worſhip of their own inventions in Publique, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lookt upon (as they ſay) as <hi>Lycurgus</hi>-like to cut up all the Vines in the Country, leſt men ſhould be drunk, but rather cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the wild Vines, whoſe fruit is ungratefull to judicious Palates, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the community of Chriſtians. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the gift of Prayer conſiſteth, we have touched before: but ſure we are, it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the volubility of the Tongue,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59605:187"/> readineſſe of Invention, fluencie of Speech, choice of Divine Phraſes, but in the grace of Prayer, which the ſame men unhappily would diſtinguiſh from the Gift; which is a certain pure intention, and fervent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Spirit lifted up to God, which may conſiſt with a Prayer uſed ten thouſand times. Not but that it is very lawfull, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and allmoſt neceſſary in ſome caſes, to utter the fullneſſe of the minde by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared words in private Addreſſes; but to lay the weight and worth of a Prayer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wording of it, is a foul abſurdity: When ſudden, ſurprizing, and extraordinary occaſions are offer'd, to blame is that man who will not ſtrive to uſe proportionable Addreſſes to God, neither ſtaying for a Book, nor the licence of his Ordinary. But plying his heart while it is hot and full, the beſt manner he can, for his eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And not onely in ſuch extraordinary caſes as may even extort an Ejaculation ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; but out of that common Habit of grace, a man may have attained unto by Chriſtian diligence, it is moſt reaſonable and pious, he ſhould lift up his minde frequently unto God in divine Contemplation, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Power, and Wiſdome, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe for deliverances and benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, imploration of his mercie and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59605:187"/> for dayly Treſpaſſes he is liable to, and exerciſing that Communion that every Good Chriſtian ſhould have with God; and all this not onely in uſuall and conſtant Phraſes and Formes, (though that be commendable) but as the Spirit ſhall give him utterance. All which notwithſtanding ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the rule of Chriſtian modeſtie, juſtice, and Charitie, ſo as not to indulge to private ſatisfactions herein, to the prejudice of others; nor to phanſie ſuch an Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelfe which ſhould tend to the diſſipation of the Church of God; that Rule of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> binding inceſſantly ſuch as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would be boundleſſe, <hi>Let no man ſeek his own, but every man anothers wealth,</hi> 1 Corinth. 10. 24. meaning rather ſpirituall, than temporall wellfare. And again, the ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14. 12. adviſeth, <hi>For as much as ye are zealous of ſpirituall gifts, ſeek that ye may excell to the edification of the Church:</hi> which whoſoever violateth by private affectations in Religion, may be ſaid to indulge rather to his own carnall humour, how divine ſoever it may appear to weaker judgements, than to the edification of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or others. For as he that ſings with the Congregation ought to lay aſide his private Tunes, though poſſibly far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than that which is ſet for all to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſo muſt the ſingular Devotion of a
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59605:188"/> higher ſtrain than ordinarie, complie with the meaner, to avoid ſcandall and confuſion: as that which may better agree with the whole Bodie, than ſublimer ſtrains or Tunes. And this is the Caſe of that plain and eaſie recitative way of uſing the Pſalmes in our Church, which requires a cheerfull Spirit, without difficulty or tediouſneſſe of modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Voice, which for that reaſon might have been preferred before the more Artificiall and hard, of private mens Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had it not pleaſed men of deſigne, and unquiet Spirits, to bring it into diſgrace, for no other faults but which are found to be more notorious in that they have introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in its ſtead. From which frowardneſſe of Spirit and ſuperſtitious admiration of ſome mens perſons, to the injurious uſage of others, God deliver them, and this Church, and from the effects of ſuch diſtempers.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IX. Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion with God in the Holy Euchariſt or Lords Supper: to which certain Inſtructions are premiſed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is the opinion of Learned Doctours, that all Orders and degrees Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall are given with deſigne to Conſecrate the Euchariſt of the Bodie and Blood of Chriſt; which may well be call'd in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: but that the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is the ſummitie of the practicall Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries left us, and ordained by Chriſt for our edification, and ſtraiteſt Union with him, is not to be denied, after ſuch grounds gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us thereof in Scripture, and aſſurances thereof from the uniſone conſent of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and holy Fathers of the Church, in all Ages; Our own Liturgie teaching us, that if with a penitent heart, and lively Faith we receive that holy Sacrament, we ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his Blood; we dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us; we are one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with us: And afterward, that hereby we evermore dwell in him, and he in us. It muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be therefore, that an intimate Union
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59605:189"/> is hereby wrought between Chriſt and the faithfull Soule, highly to be valued, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſought after, and diligently and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to be laboured for: as that true Bread which came down from Heaven, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling infinitely the <hi>Mannah</hi> which came down from Heaven: that Bread, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth not, but laſteth and leadeth unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life; as Chriſt himſelfe (<hi>John</hi> 6.) teſtifieth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But leaving to others the accurate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Majeſtie of this Myſterie, and not much employing our ſelves in the opening this Treaſurie of Grace and Mercie, we ſhall confine our ſelves to the more pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall conſideration, (and that briefly) of the right uſe of that which is ſo effectuall to the more ſtrict, full, and perfect Union with God. And to this end, we ſhall here firſt deliver certain fundamentall, or at leaſt very profitable Documents to be received and obſerved by fruitfull Communicants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Firſt then, it muſt be noted, that the things themſelves of which the Euchariſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, naturally tend no more to ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime ends and effects, than any other things; howbeit ſeverall Analogies are, by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious pietie of men alledged to declare the ſutableneſſe of the Elements to ſuch ends, not to be deſpiſed: but this muſt in the mean time, be acknowledged, that it was
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59605:189"/> both in the Liberty and Power of Chriſt to have choſen what other things he pleaſed, to have annexed his Graces unto, had it ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Secondly, That the two Elements, (for ſo are they called, not according to ſtrict ſignification, whereby there are ſaid to be four Elements in Nature, but onely as they concurre to make the Sacramentall Bodie, as they doe conſtitute the naturall bodies) are the Bread and Wine, which were in moſt common uſe in the Country where Chriſt did celebrate his laſt Supper; without any ſpeciall and preciſe Obligation of Chriſtians to the very ſame matter in all points and circumſtances; for we know not infallibly, whether the Bread was purely of one kinde of Grain, and that of Wheat, or whether there were, (as there poſſibly might be) ſome mixture in that bodie: as it is held there was in the other, the Wine. For queſtionleſſe Chriſt was not anxious him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe about that Point, neither ought we; but onely to follow and imitate him as neer as we can, by honeſt and ordinarie endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thirdly, It is to be conſidered, that whatever Treaſure of Grace and Mercie is ſaid and believed to be contained in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt by Gods dignifying and ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhing of them with them, are not ſaid
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59605:190"/> ſo neceſſarily to flow from thence that every one ſhould partake of them, who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the outward Formes. Neither are they as Pipes or Conduits which run alike to all men, that come to them, and catch what they lett fall: but as by Gods extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Power and Goodneſſe they have this ſtore of benefits given unto them, and not of themſelves; ſo, by the ſame Providence, and Wiſdome of God, are they there diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as it ſeems good unto him. And it ſeems good to him to proportion the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of them agreeable to the capacitie of the receiver. I ſay, Capacitie, and not Merits, which ſhould demand, in juſtice, what is there contained: but the Condition is there, as the Pſalmiſt hath, <hi>Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it:</hi> deſire earneſtly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy ſelfe dulie, and plentie of Bleſſings will by vertue of Gods Promiſe, redound to thee: which Benefits we ſhall hereafter touch.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fourthly, The manner of receiving Chriſt with the Bleſſings he neceſſarily brings with him in this Sacrament, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing in outward forme, from that we receive him in by his Holy Word, made known to us, and by Baptiſme, wherein we are regenerate and incorporate into the Body of Chriſt, and that by Faith too, as in the Euchariſt; but agrees in the Inward. For
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59605:190"/> the viſible Inſtruments of receiving Chriſt are much different: the Bread and Wine repreſenting Chriſt to the Eye; as the Word of God, to the Ear: And the Word of God taught and believed initiates us by Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Revelation of the Minde and Will of God, not attainable in a ſaving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but by that. The Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme carries us on from thence to Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, For hereby are we cleanſed from all our ſins. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt perfects and crowns all theſe. For as much as all other gifts and graces, upon which we are built, and in which we ſtand before God, are by this one revived, quickened, encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtrengthened. But we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a new doctrine of Faith, nor another kinde of Grace of Faith; nor another Spirit, nor another Chriſt, nor another ſpirituall life in Chriſt, but the ſame in ſubſtance all, with new advantages.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Fifthly, The outward Symboles or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of Bread and Wine called <hi>the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent and exhibite them to the duly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed Soule, are not after Conſecration, Chriſt himſelfe, any more than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: For it is one thing to ſay what thoſe ſenſible Objects are, which we call <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> (though the Sacrament properly ſo taken, conſiſteth equally of the word <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying,</hi>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:59605:191"/> and the Elements ſanctified by it) and another, to ſay what we receive in the Sacrament, which is really Chriſt. And therefore they are idle words and calumnies which men give out, that we receive not really Chriſt, or that we believe not that Chriſt is in the Sacrament, becauſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that he is the very Sacrament it ſelfe: or that Bread and Wine are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Sixthly, Whatever is viſible, tractable, taſteable in the Euchariſt is not Chriſt: And if we muſt not believe our eyes, and the eyes of all men aſſuring us that to be Bread and Wine which we behold to be ſo, then may we not believe our eares; ſo that if Chriſt ſhould tell us that it was his Bodie, we may as reaſonably denie that he doth ſay what in trueth he doth ſay: For the Eye is a leſſe fallible ſenſe than the Ear, as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers agree. And whereas it is ſaid; We cannot ſee ſubſtances themſelves, but onely Accidents, it matters not whether that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion be true or falſe, being we ſee as much of thoſe bodies, and their ſubſtances, as of any ſubſtance in the world, and no more is needfull.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Seventhly, The ſacred Symboles are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Bodie and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe we ſhould underſtand the dignity and efficacie, and ſtrait conjunction between them and Chriſt;
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59605:191"/> and Chriſt and us, who thereby receive him as our Food.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Laſtly, The meanes whereby we ſo receive Chriſt in this Bleſſed Sacrament, is Faith; as is truely and generally ſaid, but not alltogether as ſome may underſtand and conceive. For Faith, as in our Sanctification, ſo in our Juſtification doth work; and no otherwiſe doth it make us worthie, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Communicants. For it layes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all our Religion, and becoming lively by love and Charitie, gives life to all our ſpirituall performances; and, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, renders them effectuall to us. So that we muſt believe firſt according to the true Catholique Faith in generall; then ſpecially, the nature, ends and uſes of this Sacrament: Laſtly, we muſt have a comfortable perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the goodneſſe of God in accepting us in the Sacrament, and his diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; but there muſt allſo be joyned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, 1. Diſcerning the Lords Body, and that not to be it properly which we ſee: but that which is inviſible, and ſpiritually taken; 2. That we judge our ſelves by examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and humiliation of our ſelves, that by raſhneſſe of approach, we be not condemned of the Lord. 3. Invocation of Gods mercie for paſt ſins, and of his aſſiſting Grace for preventing the like future failings and falls,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59605:192"/> as we have been formerly ſubject to. 4. To have no malice nor notorious hatred in our hearts, but Charitie to all men, eſpecially towards them with whome we communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. 5. That we be void of all purpoſe or deſigne of committing over again any of thoſe ſinnes which we finde in our ſelves upon due enquity and examination, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have a ſincere, (how weak ſoever it may be) deſire and purpoſe of living more agreeably to Gods holy Will in all things. 6. That we have a good hope through Gods Grace (which ſome miſcall Faith), that we ſhall live according to our Vow in Baptiſme, of old made, and there renewed, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and that this hope begets a care and conſcience of our wayes hereafter, leſt we by relapſing into former errours diſſolve that happie Union and conjunction obtained in this Bleſſed Sacrament, <hi>with the Father and the Son.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. X. Of the Difficulties and dangers in receiving the Holie Communion, which are here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WE are told in the Office of our Church for the celebration of the Communion, <q rend="inline">"<hi>That</hi> as the benefits are great, if with a true penitent heart and a lively Faith, we receive that Holy Sacrament, ſo is the danger great if we receive the ſame unworthily; for then are we guiltie of the body and blood of our Saviour Chriſt, we eat and drink our own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not conſidering the Lords Body: we kindle Gods wrath againſt us: we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to plague us with divers Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and ſundry kindes <hi>of Death.</hi>"</q> All which ſeems to be drawn from the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelfe: not diſcerning the Lords Bodie:</hi> which Speeches it behoveth ſtraitly to underſtand aright, leſt by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59605:193"/> uſed in wreſting them to too favourable a ſenſe, we occaſion the profanation of thoſe Holy Myſteries by rudeneſſe and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unbelieving and impenitent comers unto it; or we ſo ſtraiten the way to Gods holy Table, that Believers, (and they none of the worſt rank) ſhould be diſheartened, and diſcouraged from approaching to it. The genuine ſenſe therefore and importance of thoſe Sayings, are faithfully to be unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the better informing of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and directing and ſatisfying the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the cordiall Chriſtian and ſincere. For it is moſt certain, upon too frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that an horrible abuſe is made of the opinion of the Holineſſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and allſo of the Church even now recited; and that by worldly and looſe men, who believing in groſſe the ſacredneſſe of the Communion, alledge that for a ſufficient cauſe to excuſe themſelves from receiving of it, when (God knowes) they have little apprehenſion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Holineſſe of that, or their unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe or unfitneſſe; pretending more ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſſe and warineſſe than others, and than the Word of God requires abſolutely at their hands: though it is granted, that divers finde themſelves ſo entangled between the conſciouſneſſe of their own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and perſwaſion of the worthineſſe
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59605:193"/> of that, that they are unwillingly obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in drawing nigh thus unto Chriſt ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully offered to them. For whoſe ſake I have prepared theſe following inſtructions, leaving others to be condemned for their falſeneſſe, and hypocriſie in ſacred things, by their own conſciences, and that very judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is pretended to be feared in ſo abſtaining.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Firſt then, It is to be granted and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by all ingenuous as well as pious Chriſtians, that it is in it ſelfe incredible, and a great injurie done to the wiſdome and goodneſſe of Chriſt inſtituting this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to imagine that he ſhould ſo mock the greateſt number of true, though weak Believers, as to ordain ſuch a Sacrament, and to ſuch great ends, and propound ſo great benefits, and leave ſo many gracious and kinde invitations and exhortations to come to him there preſent and in readineſſe to ſatisfie the hungrie Soule with goodneſſe, and to feaſt him with the fat and ſweet of his own Table; and yet withall, cloth that precious Ordinance with ſo many ſevere cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and clogge it with ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, difficult, and heavie Conditions, as very few ſhould dare to come at it, or be the better for it.</p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:59605:194"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Secondly, There is to be obſerved a very great difference between Worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, and due or Fit communicating; and that both theſe are vulgarly and Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly contained in that one word, <hi>Worthie,</hi> which hath a double ſenſe. For he properly is ſaid to be worthy, who is equall in qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Vertue and Graces, to the worth and merits of that holy Sacrament; and in this acceptation, no man may be ſaid to be worthy, no not the beſt prepared, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt man. Another ſenſe of Worthineſſe is that we call'd <hi>Fitneſſe,</hi> whereby, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſoever a Soule may be of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, he may be reputed worthy, and come acceptably and fruitfully: and ſo, that willfully in ſuch caſes, to abſent himſelfe may turne to his own perdition more than his coming. For excepting ſome monſtrous and notorious evills into which a man may fall, and that when the Communion is inſtant, ſo that no competent time nor meanes remain to diſcharge his part in due preparation, (though ſudden accidents of that nature may admitt of ſudden remorſe, and intenſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, when time is denied of more full and thorow humiliation) then perhaps ſuch excuſes may be tolerable, as unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but when men have timely advice of ſuch enſuing Solemnitie, and have no una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable impediments, but wilfully, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59605:194"/> involve themſelves in matters incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it, and ſo abſent themſelves, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that competent preparation required, then doe they ſhun the Curſe of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unworthily, and fall into the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of not preparing themſelves, and contempt of ſuch meanes of Salvation; as he under the Law that refuſed to purge his Houſe of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and purifie himſelfe to eat the Paſſe-over.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For in this one Evill, many more are contained, ſuch as are fruſtrating Gods invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Grace and Mercy: a great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of men who are of the ſame nature with our ſelves, though greater in Power and Honour. A bereaving our ſelves of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits there tendered: and an hazarding of the loſſe of the fruits of all other meanes ordained by God to our Salvation. For God requires that we <hi>ſhould put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 11, 13. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4. 12. exhorteth to ſtand perfect and compleat in all the will of God. And Saint <hi>James</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he ſhall be guilty of all,</hi> James 2. 10. inſinuating ſufficiently unto us, that the will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neglect of one ſuch materiall Dutie, and violating one ſo ſoveraign Ordinance as this, doth injury to all; and provokes God to withdraw his Bleſſing upon thoſe other Ordinances we are content to admitt of,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59605:195"/> For he that contemns him in one, contemns the Authour of all: and ſo cannot reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect any benefit from Sermons, or from Publique, or private ſervice of God. For no man muſt truſt to his making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to God one way, having wronged him in another, where both may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed. And experience teacheth this to be true, that none are generally more rare and remiſſe in the other parts of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, than they who are careleſſe in this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A manifold Scandall is offered to Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſtians; who, upon obſerving the neglect of ſome in this point, entertain ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the little uſe of it; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the offence in omitting the ſame is very inconſiderable, and light; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it over accordingly: or perhaps, that receiving that Sacrament belongs chiefly to the Greater, or better ſort, and ſuch as are more at leiſure than are they, and not to poor, obſcure, and buſie perſons, as they are. Furthermore, a Scandall is hereby given to the Brethren of the ſame Faith and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if a Member of the Church were fallen away from them, and found ſome evill in the Actions ſacred. For God doth not onely require at our hands that we ſhould truely believe and become lively Members of Chriſts myſticall Body, and inviſible; but allſo, Viſible; and not onely ſo, but
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59605:195"/> that ſo far as lies in us, we ſhould be viſible members allſo of that Body Viſible, and that we ſhould declare the ſame, and doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give ground or occaſion to believe otherwiſe of us: which muſt neceſſarily be, if we forbear ſuch neceſſary and ſolemn proofs, and indications as this is, even the Greateſt of all: and that, which, as it is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive of us to Chriſt, ſo is it very effectuall to produce and preſerve that bond of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which Chriſt commands to be kept up amongſt Brethren in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The main pretence and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie of abſtaining from the Communion taken from its Sacredneſſe, and formidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are grounded upon the foreſaid words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which therefore to give a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and proper ſenſe of, will be very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: which we may attain to two wayes chiefly. Firſt, by rightly underſtanding the occaſion given him to write ſo ſeverely; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others. For we finde nothing of the like charge given by Chriſt to his Diſciples, at the firſt Inſtitution of it; all which came with no other preparation to it, than was Legall, or Leviticall. Neither have we in holy Writ any thing afterward, except the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> about it; who upon groſſe corruptions and ſcandalous, invading openly that holy Sacrament, opportunely beſtirs himſelfe for the vindication of it
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59605:196"/> from ſuch abuſes; brings them back to the firſt inſtitution of Chriſt; which was that they ſhould underſtand, that to eat this as their own Supper, was to profane it: For Chriſt at that time had two Suppers, One Moſaicall, which though it had ſacred Rites belonging to it, did ſerve to the uſe of the naturall Body, and was to imprint in their memories a ſenſe of their deliverance from ſlaughter, with the Firſt-born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from bondage there allſo. The other was Evangelicall, not given in ſuch quantitie as the other, to nouriſh the Bodie, but cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly rather, in ſuch ſort as might give the receiver certain information, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable affection of the Paſſion and death of Chriſt, whoſe Bodie was broken, and Blood ſhed for the ſinnes of the whole World, much more of true Believers. Which, if they who received thoſe Elements, did not conſider of, ſo as in them to diſcern the Lords Bodie thereby ſignified, and his Paſſion thereby called to remembrance, and received by the faithfull to their edification in faith and love and comfort, but prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ventured to take it as common bread; yea to come to it firſt ſtuffed full with their own riotous Suppers, and drunk with exceſſe of Wine, before; all the world would judge and condemne them for ſo doing; and more eſpecially would God be avenged
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59605:196"/> of them, for ſuch affront put upon him, and thoſe divine Myſteries of his ordaining, and that by ſudden Deaths, or grievous Sickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and weakneſſes upon their bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the evill upon their Soules. Others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to eat and drink at home in their Houſes, kept their ſtomachs for the good Cheer they were wont to make, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully to take in Gods Houſe, or the place, and at the time they ſhould have ſoberly, modeſtly, and devoutly partaken of theſe great Myſteries: which worthily ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed the Apoſtle, as to demand if they had not Houſes of their own to eat and to drink in, but muſt come into the publique place of Worſhip, the Houſe of God, and there gluttonize and revell, not conſidering nor diſcerning the Lords Body; to the ſhame of themſelves and Religion. And that this is the moſt plain and naturall ſenſe of that whole paſſage of the Apoſtle, will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to every attentive and judicious Reader taking in the Context. And this St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> than whome none of his time, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies more the Myſteries of the Euchariſt, doth agree to, in a ſecond Homilie he hath upon the Paſſeover, <hi>Tom.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 921. telling us, that thoſe Chriſtians ſo reprehended by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> turned the Holy Euchariſt into coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly junketting, taking occaſion from that to eat and drink to exceſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:59605:197"/>
                  <p n="4">4. And that this was the opinion of the Primitive Chriſtians, before <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s days, that the formidableneſſe of the Euchariſt was not ſuch, but it might be approached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to upon lower and eaſier termes than are taught by ſome Perſons, appeareth from the dayly Communion in uſe amongſt them, which could not conſiſt with that dayly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, and exact preparation judged now a days indiſpenſably neceſſary. All which I here ſpeak, to make good what I ſaid of a two-fold worthineſs and unworthineſs in receiving the Lords Supper; the one, which indeed brings damnation with it by contrarie Qualities in a Receiver, to that Ordinance: ſuch as the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were guiltie of, ſo reproved by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> And another of negative unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which may be direct infidelity; which makes men wholly uncapable of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſuppoſes Baptiſme and Faith anſwerable: or a diſproportionable Faith, and knowledge, and repentance, and other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications very well becoming that; which yet doth not make any man abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of it, or the thing damnable to him; provided that he comes with ſome ſound and good degree of preparation, though ſmall and weak; having a pure intention: ſuch as theſe may run the hazard of their Soules in affected abſtaining, as well as in ſcandalous receiving that Holy Supper. For were it
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59605:197"/> ſo, that we were ſo pure and clear of ſin about us, and ſo perfect as ſome require to a due preparation, we need not come to the Lords Supper at all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fourthly, It is a common Allegation againſt Communicating, that there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and their Neighbours; and thereupon they hold themſelves ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently exempted from that Holy Sacrament. But this declining the Euchariſt may no leſſe tend to our condemnation than ſo coming. For men ought to uſe all fair and ordinarie meanes for reconciliation, which willfully neglected makes them unfit to pray as well as to communicate. But if they have us'd their Chriſtian endeavours to live in peace and Charitie, and actually doe what is juſt and reaſonable to all men, and their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are fruſtrated by the peeviſhneſſe, obſtinacie, and ill minde of others, men are not thereby uncapable of thoſe Myſteries; another man having no power over my Soule to render it unworthy of them, nor to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice another in his Rights towards God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>MY Son,</hi> ſaith the wiſe Man, <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus</hi> 2. 1. <hi>if thou come to ſerve the Lord, prepare thy Soule for temptation:</hi> So that they who, out of a good conſcience draw nigh unto God, doe not come to a ſtate of tranquillity or ſecuritie from troubles and diſquietings either outward or inward; ſpirituall or worldly, but to protection and preſervation under ſuch conflicts as happen to them. For he that is not taken into the militarie Service of his Prince, lives more at eaſe than he that ſerves under him in his Wars. The Church of Chriſt it ſelfe is Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant; and therefore if we be ſound and true members of that Bodie, ſo muſt we all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be excerciſed with the like wars, and make it our buſineſſe to fullfill the Office we bear: according to the counſell and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3, 4. <hi>Thou therefore endure hardneſſe as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt. No man that warreth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himſelfe with the affairs of this life,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59605:198"/> that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a Souldier.</hi> And it was the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Auncient and holy Woman <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletica,</hi> that by how much a Chriſtian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier profited in holineſſe, by ſo much ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger were his Adverſaries which oppoſed him. (<hi>Apophtheg. Syncletic.</hi>) And how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care a true Chriſtian taketh in keeping a good conſcience void of offence towards God and towards man, as did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> by ſo much are multiplied his fears and ſcruples, and ſenſe of offence within himſelfe: as in the ordering of the outward man; none take cold oftener than they who are more carefull than ordinarie to keep themſelves warme. Upon which Subject of temptations in its latitude, becauſe I cannot ſpeak here, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my ſelfe to thoſe proper to our Subject of due communicating, which are not few, but yet but few I ſhall here conſider, and thoſe the moſt common.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One generall Remedie againſt this may be that of <hi>Luther:</hi> who, upon due eſteem had of the holineſſe of the Lords Supper, and the danger of unworthie communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, was ſo infeſted with temptations of the Devill, that he could never reſt in quiet for them, untill he abruptly and boldly brake through them all, by bidding defiance in a blunt and ſlovenly manner to him, (which was no new thing with him) and ſo ſhaking
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59605:199"/> off ſuch ſcruples, went about the work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſumption ſtill, or unprofitable delaies. For unleſſe a man with humble courage, ſometimes applies himſelfe to that work, he ſhall like ſuch Children, who at the leaſt croſſe, put their Fingers in their Eyes, ſpend his time in lamenting and bewailing himſelfe without that confidence in God becoming him, and dutie towards him and himſelfe. For, as I remember the compariſon of an Auncient Aſcetique or Secluſe to be, that as in Onions taking off one Coat ſphericall, there will preſently appear another: ſo in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one being withſtood, overcome, and removed, another ariſes to be taken off all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: ſo that temptations become a diſeaſe in ſome, and therefore rather to be oppoſed than humour'd. Which is not to be applied to them whoſe ſcruples are weighty, or very moleſting; and ought to be made known to the Phyſician of the Soule, whoſe Office it is to applie Remedies thereunto. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the caſe of the Holy Communion; as by the practice of the holy Catholique Church we are directed, and particularly by our own, in the Exhortation appointed at the giving warning to the People of a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at hand.</p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:59605:199"/>
                  <p n="3">3. More particularly, Cares of the world, and Croſſes in the world are commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as juſtifiable impediments of coming to the Holy Table: which ſometimes is quite otherwiſe, and ſhould be an argument inducing us to flee to thoſe powerfull meanes of lightening our burden, and maſtering thoſe temptations which threaten our greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and miſchief. For if coming to Chriſt in the ordinarie way of Faith, and truſt in God, be of that efficacie which Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, inviting to come unto him, all that are wearie and heavie laden, and he will give reſt unto the Soule, as is there intimated; what may we not 'expect from Chriſt, when he ſo cometh unto us as in the Euchariſt, with greater plenitude of Graces? And therefore ſurely they that deal uprightly with God, and prudently with their own Soules may from hence be ſtirred up to a more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire of communicating, rather than ſhun or avoid it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But in other caſes, there may be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made. For ſome ſollicitudes and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances are ſuch as men unwillingly are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, which could neither be foreſeen nor prevented; but involuntarily and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly fall between the Cupp and the Lips, as the ſaying is. Such as were ſudden and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarie uncleanneſſes happening to a man bent to keep the Paſſeover. And ſo
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59605:200"/> ſome monſtrous ſurpriſe of ſin againſt God, may well detain a man from preſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt ſacred things, untill he hath humbled himſelfe, and repented thereof in ſome good degree: Or perhaps ſome ſore and ſudden conſternation of minde, upon ſome grievous accident, not ſuddenly to be overcome, may excuſe a man, for that time: yet with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that no man pleaſes himſelfe or takes content in ſuch abſtaining, but preſerves entire his good deſire that way, labouring to remove that obſtacle; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by <hi>Poſtfact,</hi> it becomes voluntarie, and ſo verie criminall. But when impediments are directly voluntarie, as affected blindneſſe, and negligence in preparing a mans ſelfe, and valuing and approving our ſins, ſo that we will not be at the trouble or care to part with them; or project, and modellize world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs, ſo that we bring encumbrances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves at ſuch times, that we cannot fit our ſelves for heavenly things as becometh us; and then Apologize for our ſelves that we could not doe it; as men weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with late working on Saturday nights, that they muſt ſleep out ſome part of the Morning Service on Sundayes, or by worſe exerciſes indiſpoſe themſelves to ſerve God, or deſigne to viſite a Friend, or take a Walk, or entertain Friends, when they ſhould both be ſerving God; and then ſay they were ſo
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59605:200"/> hindred that they could not doe their dutie to God at ſuch times and in ſuch manner as required, what is this elſe but a profeſſed mocking of God, which comes to thus much in plain termes; they could not come to God becauſe they would not; but by devices of their own made it neceſſarie for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtay away. But where multitude of buſineſſes, by vertue of Occupations vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie, lie heavie on a man and obſtruct him, he is obliged ſo to modell worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that they may comply better with and obey heavenly: <hi>For a Good man</hi> (ſayes the Pſalmiſt) <hi>will guide his affairs with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Pſalm 112. which prudence is ſeen in nothing more than in giving ſuperiority and rule to things of greateſt worth and dignity, over inferiour, ordained by God to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and not to uſurp over Diviner, and more heavenly. And this Methode being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the diligence we are bound to uſe, and doe uſe about this holy Sacrament, may prove an help, by Gods bleſſing, towards the more eaſie management of worldly things allſo: as the wiſdome and Righteouſneſſe of <hi>Noah</hi> was predicted to give comfort to men concerning the work of their hands, becauſe of the ground which the Lord had curſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 29.</p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:59605:201"/>
                  <p n="5">5. It is allſo objected by divers againſt themſelves many times, that they fear they want that Faith, and true Repentance, and fervent Charity which God requires of ſuch as ſo ſolemnly draw neer unto him. Which ſuppoſing to be ſincere and cordiall, (which ſundry times is otherwiſe) the reſolution of this difficultie is not difficult: For where ſuch holy ſenſe of defects is, there they are very pardonable, and curable. For it is a notable proof of Gods work in the heart, to be ſo ſenſible of a mans imperfections and unworthineſſe, and a demonſtration of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Life, and ſuch a competent degree of goodneſſe, as may be, according to <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>'s judgement, a tolerable qualification to receive thoſe holy Myſteries. For what greater or better part of Repentance is there than humiliation upon ſuch apprehenſions, and Aſpiration after Reformation and growth in Grace? And the old Rule and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Stoicks holds good here allſo, as well as in the naturall man: <hi>If thou feareſt thou art dead, thou art certainly alive;</hi> for wert thou not ſo, thou couldſt not fear.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But notwithſtanding very expedient and ſafe it is, for ſuch conſcientiouſly ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, to conſult with the Officer God has appointed to ſuch ends, as is ſaid before: and might be more fully declared from the Reſemblance and agreement between the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:59605:201"/> the Leviticall Prieſt had to diſcerne, judge, quitt, or binde Perſons unclean Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaically: And from the direct ſentence of Chriſt himſelfe, concerning the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Prieſts, <hi>viz. He that heareth you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, and he that heareth me, heareth</hi> (or receiveth) <hi>him that ſent me.</hi> And fidelitie, taciturnitie, and opinion of fallible men, ſuch as are Phyſicians and Lawyers, move men to make known their moſt important Affaires, and ſometimes ſhamefull Diſeaſes, upon hopes of good counſell, and comfortable recoverie of health; Why ſhould not men put the like confidence in the Phyſician in Ordinarie to the Soule? Gods Miniſters being under ſtronger bonds of fidelitie, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and ſecrecie, than any ſecular Perſon in their Sphere: who incurre not any ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as doe Prieſts diſcovering ſecrets; nor becoming ſo odious to God and man for ſuch falſeneſſe and treacherie: and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and uſe being no leſſe in Divine than ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Laſtly, As there is a great preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raſhly and without honeſt endeavours, to come unto the Communion; ſo may there be an impediment in the preparation it ſelfe we make, of coming worthily, when men put ſuch great confidence in their devout pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations as if they might expect an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible wellcome upon the worth of ſuch their
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59605:202"/> endeavours. Every man indeed ought ſo to eat and drink there, as that he may hope to be accepted well by God, but not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his preparation, which can amount to no more than to remove obſtacles out of the way; but not ſo far of it ſelfe prevail with God, as to oblige him to gratifie him: but to this nothing is more powerfull with God than Humilitie, and depending on Gods free grace and mercie, for a fruitfull event; and to have ſuch a pure intention to that ſacred Work, and reliance on Gods Mercie, that he may ſilence the temptations of the Enemie either to preſumption or puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and deſpondencie, with that ſaying of <hi>Bernard</hi>'s anſwering the Tempter in like caſes: I began not for thee, neither will I give over for thee.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THUS have we brought the true Believer and Liver from the ſtate of Nature which is darkneſſe and confuſion, unto a ſtate of Illumination and Regeneration by Baptiſme, and the Concomitant inſtructions of Faith imbibed at that time, when he came out of the womb of the Church, the Font: And from thence, led him to the higher and ſtronger acts of the Spirituall Man, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Purgation of the Soule ſo Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and purifying of it from dead works to ſerve the living God, and eſpecially by Selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall and ſubduing the will of Nature to the Will of God, and the will of the Fleſh to the will of the Spirit: For as we live in the Spirit, ſo are we to walk in the Spirit: according to St. <hi>Paul, Galat.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>For by Baptiſme,</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10.) <hi>we are his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good workes, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them:</hi> and eſpecially calling all good
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59605:203"/> Souldiers of Chriſt Jeſus as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> did the chief of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſet their feet on the necks of the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Princes, to trample upon thoſe ſeven Capitall Sins, which not only fight againſt our Soules them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but are leaders on of others to aſſault and ſpoil us. And from hence have we led the Soule to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Way of Contemplation, and Love, and Acquieſcence in God, to have a certain fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of the fruit of that Land of Promiſe we long after and expect, by the conjunction the Soule hath with God: which we finde not ſo extravagant a Notion, ſtraining the ſimpler Doctrine of Faith, and Chriſt to a ſenſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to Eares not throughly opened to the Myſteries of Religion, but a ſmattering thereof was had by Auncient Philoſophers; as appears by the diſquiſitions between <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrie</hi> and <hi>Jamblichus,</hi> of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; where great things are ſpoken of the Anagogicall way of converſing with the gods, by elevation of the underſtanding through true knowledge of God: and that <hi>Theur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> i. e.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59605:203"/> the light of the Goſpell and Doctrine of Chriſt, with infinite leſſe ſuperſtition, and more perſpicuitie, puritie, and ſimplicitie conducteth to that Aſcent of the Soule, and reſting in God which makes us like unto him, and <hi>Perfect as our Father which is in heaven is perfect,</hi> Matth. 5. with allowances for the infirmities of Fleſh and blood, and mutableneſſe we are ſubject unto: being as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For though the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Now thanks be to God which allwayes cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt,</hi> have their true ſenſe; yet that, I ſuppoſe, is of the ſtate of a Chriſtian, which is firme and ſure reſting upon this Foundation, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his:</hi> and he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave his choſen ones, untill they totally forſake him; if that may be ſaid. But as to the actuall and continuall poſſeſſion by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in him, and ſpirituall ſenſations, the Chriſtian is mutable here, and that, which not without great difficulty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry is for ſome time attained unto, is in a ſhort time, and ſuddenly interrupted and hid from the eyes, to the great diſmaying of the devout Soule: ſo that great care is to be taken, as well to hold that comfortable communion with God, as to acquire it; and to recover it intermitted, as once to have attained it. For as the Sheet let down from
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59605:204"/> Heaven <hi>by the four Corners</hi> to Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 12. wherein he ſaw, in a Viſion, all manner of Fare, his Appetite could long for, was as ſuddenly again taken up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo is it with the delectations which the Spirit feeleth, let down from Heaven to its wonderfull content; they are ſuddenly taken away up into Heaven again. And when we imagine our ſelves in the third Heaven with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> we unexpectedly feel a Thorne in the fleſh to humble us; leſt we ſhould be exalted above meaſure; For Paradiſe here would be the greateſt temptation to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into ſin. So that as we read of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the Elect of God, and taken by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence out of his own Countrie and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ſignifying the ſtate of Nature to us, was led into the Land of Promiſe and ſhown it, but had no Inheritance in it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>no not ſo much as to ſet his foot,</hi> Acts 7. So hath the religious Soule no footing firme here, though by Faith and Affection it hath before its eyes the promiſed Poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is therefore one principall Rule of rightly uſing what we have at any time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, in Conſolations, (the fruit of Union with God, but not inceſſant, or inſeparable from it) to underſtand ſo much, leſt finding our ſelves fruſtrated of our expectations, we call in queſtion the ſtate it ſelfe we are in; and bring unprofitable confuſions upon our
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59605:204"/> ſelves. For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>We are dead, and our life is hid with Chriſt; When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we allſo appear with him in glory.</hi> The time will come, but is not yet come, that we ſhould ſee what is better now hid and kept with Chriſt, till ſuch time as the ſecond fullneſſe of time ſhall come, and Chriſt too; when our life will be manifeſted. It may be that a loving Father towards an obſequious and dutifull Child, may ſometimes ſhew him the Grand Deed whereby he hath ſettled a great Eſtate upon him, yea may carrie him out, and ſhew him the Lands, Houſes, Mines, and Timber on them, which he purpoſes to give him, but none of theſe are at all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to the main end it ſelfe, but onely to his encouragement, to perſevere in his dutie. No more is neceſſarie to a certainty of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an aſſurance of Salvation, or ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary arguments thereof; as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us, we ſhould fall into deſpondencie and ſluggiſhneſſe of Spirit, or be weak-handed in Gods ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For ſecondly; God may hereby have a gracious and wiſe deſigne, to wean the fond minde from ſenſible Delectations, whereby it ſhould take up, ſhort of the ultimate end of all, God himſelfe; ſeeking its will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent rather than Gods; to which the more truely ſpirituall a man is, ſo much more he
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59605:205"/> is intent above all things; and leſſe mindes intermediate conſolations; which the leſſe they are contended for, the oftener they happen.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thirdly, The Patience and conſtancie of the faithfull Servant of God by ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his fatherly wiſdome and pleaſure in ſuch Diſpenſation, is exerciſed and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And that he doth not ſerve God, nor follow Chriſt meerly for the Loaves, which he miraculouſly feeds ſome with; but for his own ſake. We all know the beginning, middle, and Concluſion of holy <hi>Job</hi>'s life, how religious and proſperous he was at the ſame time, before God: and how miſerable he was, by the ſame Providence, remaining all that while invincible in his reſolutions of adhering to God, and perſerving in his wonted righteouſneſſe: whereby he declared that his Pietie was not built upon the fluid Elements of this World, nor the ſenſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts pertaining to the ſervice of God, but the intrinſick excellencie of Religion it ſelfe, carrying its Reward with it. And ſo, (as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeakes) we know the end of him and ſuch his patience, and faith. For ſo it pleaſeth God himſelfe to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the hardſhip brought upon his own People travailing fourtie yeares in the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Wilderneſſe, <hi>viz. that he might doe them good at the latter end:</hi> not feaſting them
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59605:205"/> ſo by the way, that they ſhould not deſire to enter into any other reſt. For as we ſee it is with the Day-labourer, that his Meals are very ſhort in compariſon of his toyl; ſo is it allſo with the faithfulleſt Servants of God in this life, their ſpirituall refreſhments are not comparable to their labour in working out their ſalvation with fear and trembling: ſo that, as <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerveth, the Dayes are rare, and the ſtayes are ſhort, of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And a fourth reaſon hereof may be, Gods great deſigne to keep the Soule in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which might be endanger'd, by ſuch exaltations; and upon which, inferiour and harder ſervices might be ſlighted and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as more proper for Perſons not ſo highly priviledged. Or it may be vainly preſumed, that ſuch priviledges are granted to the Soule for its extraordinary diligence in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which muſt not be allowed, but looked upon as an overplus of his favour.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Fifthly, The withholding or withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch delectations in Gods ſervice, may be to inſtruct us in the abſolute Will of God, to keep times and ſeaſons in his own Power, which it is not for us to know, as Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. And <hi>that the Kingdome of God cometh not by obſervation,</hi> or according to our expectations.</p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:59605:206"/>
                  <p n="8">8. But becauſe it is very acceptable to God, that we ſhould in all our ſervices, give a cheerfull Sacrifice to him, which cheerfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is much advanced by the ſenſe of Gods good will towards us, ſuch a lightneſſe of ſpirit is not to be wholly ſlighted, as it is not too importunately to be ſought after. The meanes therefore to obtain the ſame may be, Firſt, The due obſervation of the foregoing Rules now mentioned. Secondly, A free ſubmiſſion of our ſelves and ſervices to the diſpoſition of the will of God, and contentedneſſe to perſiſt unalterably in our ſtation, under ſuch Aridities, of which we know not our ſelves to be direct occaſions; a great motive to incline God to manifeſt his favour unto us more fully. Which calls to my minde what I have been told to have happened in the Court of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt; (For why may we not illuſtrate things as well by Moderne, as Auncient Examples; and Domeſtick as well as Forein) in which rare and noble divertiſements being prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the delight of ſuch as he favoured, an inferiour perſon demanded entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of ſuch Splendour; but being repulſed by a Noble Perſon to whome the power of admiſſion was given, He ſaid; Well, if I muſt not be admitted, I know what I will doe. Doe? ſaid the Noble Man, Why? What will you doe? I will goe home
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59605:206"/> (ſaid the other) and goe to Bed. Nay then, if you be ſo indifferent and well content without it, come in, replied that Lord. So doth it uſually happen unto ſuch who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſire to be admitted into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in this way of ſenſible delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet with patience and ſubmiſſion abſolute to Gods Will, readily and quietly reſt in their ordinarie Dutie ordained of God to walk in here, in fullfilling his Will ſo on Earth, as it is in Heaven; according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane abilitie, where alone is the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Union we have but in part here, never to be diſſolved or interrupted: Laſt of all, Retirement for ſome time into our private Chambers; and then into our own ſelves, by ſtillneſſe and compoſedneſſe of ſpirit, and minde, from not onely world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cogitations, but forcible (as I may ſo ſpeak) devotions towards God; becomeing, as it were, Blanks before him, that ſo he may write his own will, and in his own way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soule: and having ſo done, not to intermitt the wonted Worſhip of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private, or publique: fullfilling what is ſaid, <hi>Lamentations</hi> 3. 28. <hi>He ſitteth alone and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath born it upon him. He putteth his mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there may be hope.</hi> For it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that a great miſtake is committed through the ſpeciouſneſſe of the condition of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59605:207"/> ſerving God, and having him in our Eye, as if we intended nothing more than a more cheerfull and acceptable ſervice, when love of our ſelves bears the greateſt ſhare in the purſuit of ſuch ſerenities of minde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations. For the Soule finding an heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wearineſſe upon it, naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires eaſe and relief, which Religion it ſelfe does not denie or diſallow; provided it be pure from Selfe-love often concerned herein. And an humble apprehenſion of our vileneſſe, unworthineſſe, and unfitneſſe to entertain Chriſt in ſuch ſingular manner, moving one to cry out in the words and Spirit of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 5. 8. <hi>Depart from me for I am a ſinfull man, O Lord,</hi> may be as great an argument of the profitable and ſaving Preſence of Chriſt, as the poſſeſſion of him in Conſolations; and a more readie way to attain what is really good for us, though not directly craved, in this kinde.</p>

                  <p>MOST High and Holy Lord God, whome the Heaven of heavens cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; who dwelleſt on high, and yet hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt thy ſelfe to behold the things done in heaven and earth: yea to dwell with them that are of an humble ſpirit and broken heart: and takeſt the ſimple out of the duſt, and lifteſt the poor out of the mire to ſet him with Princes, even with the Princes of his People: even with thine holy Angells, and the Spirits of juſt men made perfect. And to this end vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeſt to begin that glorious ſtate, here, by that ſtate of Grace whereby thou entereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soules of thy Servants and dwelleſt with them, and art united to them: O moſt Gracious Father in thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, and through thy Holy Spirit, be pleaſed to deſcend into my heart, and make thy abode with me, as by thy Son thou haſt promiſed; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite my heart to fear thy Name: Open the eyes of my underſtanding that I may ſee the wondrous
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59605:208"/> things of thy Law, and with cleer and pure Contemplation of thee and things ſpirituall and Heavenly, may be ſo far inflamed with the love of thee and thy Worſhip, that all earthly and ſenſuall contents and pleaſures may be ſtrange and unſavourie to me: and that ſuch a ſpirituall guſt may ſo affect my Soule that I may refuſe all delights and glories not placed in thee and derived from thee, and tending to thee: which may more firmely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige and endear me to thee; ſo that Nuptiall Bond, whereby thou haſt eſpouſed me to thee and thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, may never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: but amidſt the many cares, troubles and temptations which may befall me in this life, I may conſtantly and faithfully perſevere to ſerve thee without diſtraction, and much more alienation from thee. Thou knoweſt, O Lord, that this corruptible bodie preſſeth down the Soule muſing on heavenly things: thou knoweſt, that though our ſpirit be willing, our fleſh is weak, and yet haſt taught us, that thy Grace is ſufficient for us, and thy ſtrength is made known in our weakneſſe, as thy mercy is in our wickedneſſe: wherefore Righteous Father, take poſſeſſion of this thine Houſe which thou haſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to dwell in, vindicate me from the uſurpations of ſin, the fleſh, the Devill and all worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities apt to deceive me, or draw me from thee: that ſo like thy ſervant <hi>Stephen</hi> by a
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59605:208"/> ſtrong eye of Faith evermore ſtedfaſtly behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee and the glorie with thee, I may joy in thee here, and everlaſtingly enjoy thee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</p>
